Data of this study come from several platforms. Consequently, the final database is the result of a long step process.Firstly, I downloaded green metrics from [`NewsWeek`](http://www.newsweek.com/2014/06/13/newsweeks-green-rankings-2014-253482.html) for each year's ranking (i.e. 2014 to 2016). All companies were not automatically listed in the three rankings. Thus, I had to match companies that were listed in each ranking. This step had been carried out through excel \footnote{see the file \texttt{Child/Analysis/DataBase/NewsWeekGreenRankin/RechercheMatch 14-16.xlsx}}. Among those three rankings and of the 500 US companies, 405 companies were listed for each year. 

Secondly, I obtained some of the financial data (i.e. ROA, Financial Leverage, Total Assets and Net Margin) on [`Morningstar`](http://www.morningstar.be/be/default.aspx). To do that, I have used its [`API`](https://gist.github.com/hahnicity/45323026693cdde6a116#file-morningstar-api-md). The platform has saved key ratios data in `csv` format for each company. Consequently, I have written an `R` script which downloads each `csv` file and bring all data into a tidy database. The `R` script is available on my `GitHub` account `https://github.com/pkinif/Thesis` in `Child/Analysis/MakeFile_WebScrapMorningStars.Rmd`. Outputs of this makefile are in the folder `Child/Analysis/DataBase/MorningStar`. 

Due to missing values regarding previous financial variables, I had to complete the database with data coming from [`StockPup`](http://www.stockpup.com/). The same process than for `Morningstar` has been applied. The `R` script is available on my `GitHub` account `https://github.com/pkinif/Thesis` in the file `Child/Analysis/MakeFile_WebScrapStockPup.Rmd`. Outputs are in the folder `Child/Analysis/DataBase/StockPup`. 

Thirdly, I completed my database with data coming from [`Ycharts`](https://ycharts.com/). On this platform, I collected Tobin's Q. At the date of collect, Ycharts offered a 7-day free trial. The makefile path is `Child/Analysis/MakeFile_WebScrapYcharts.Rmd`. Outputs of this makefile are in the folder `Child/Analysis/DataBase/Ycharts`. 

Finally, I have synchronized all data into a tidy database. The makefile is `Child/Analysis/MakeFile_DataSynchronization.Rmd`. Outputs are saved into the folder `Child/Analysis/DataBase/DataSynchronization`.
