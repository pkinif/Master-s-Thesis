The data of this study comes from several platforms and the final database is the result of a long step process.

First, I have downloaded the green data from [NewsWeek](http://www.newsweek.com/2014/06/13/newsweeks-green-rankings-2014-253482.html) for each years ranking (i.e. 2014 to 2016). All companies were not automatically listed in the three rankings. Consequently, I had to look after companies that were listed in each ranking. This step had been carried out through excel (see the file *Child/Analysis/DataBase/NewsWeekGreenRankin/RechercheMatch 14-16.xlsx* ) using some *vlookup*. Among those three rankings and of the 500 US companies, 405 companies were listed for each years. 

Second, I have used [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.be/be/default.aspx) to get the financial data. More precisely, I have used its [API](https://gist.github.com/hahnicity/45323026693cdde6a116#file-morningstar-api-md). The platform have saved key ratios data in csv format for each company. The common csv path is:  *http://financials.morningstar.com/ajax/exportKR2CSV.html?t=FB*. You can observe that the ticker of the company stands at the end of the path. Consequently I have written an R code which download each csv file and bring all data into a tidy database. The R code is available in the following file :  *Child/Analysis/MakeFile_WebScrapMorningStars.Rmd* and the outputs of this make file are in the folder *Child/Analysis/DataBase/MorningStar*. 

Third, I have downloaded all financial data on [StockPup](http://www.stockpup.com/). I have used the same process than for Morningstar. The website have saved financial data for each company in a csv file (e.g. http://www.stockpup.com/data/A_quarterly_financial_data.csv). Consequently I have written an R code to make a loop on each companies to dowload the csv file. Then all data had been compiled into a tidy database. The make file is available ath the folowing path : *Child/Analysis/MakeFile_WebScrapStockPup.Rmd*. Outputs of this make file are in this folder *Child/Analysis/DataBase/StockPup*. 

Fourth, I have completed my database with data coming from [Ycharts](https://ycharts.com/). On this platform I have collected the Tobin's Q. At the date of collect, Ycharts offered a 7-day free trial. I have also used R to bring all data into a tidy database. The make file path is : *Child/Analysis/MakeFile_WebScrapYcharts.Rmd*. Outputs of this make file are in this folder *Child/Analysis/DataBase/Ycharts*. 

Fifth, I have synchronized all data into one tidy database. The make file is *Child/Analysis/MakeFile_DataSynchronization.Rmd* and outputs are saved in the following folder : *Child/Analysis/DataBase/DataSynchronization*.
