\textit{I would first like to express my deep gratitude to Professor Sophie Béreau and Professor Jean-Yves Gnabo, my research supervisors, for their guidance and useful critiques. I would also like to thank Professor Paulo Roberto Feldmann and Professor Paulo Tromboni de Souza Nascimento who taught  me the necessary scientific research expertise to fulfill this master's thesis. I am also very thankful to Mr. Patrick Virakam, Risk reporting team leader at Banque International à Luxembourg, who gave me the computer skills I needed to carry out this research project. Finally, I wish to thank my family and friends for their support and encouragement.}
