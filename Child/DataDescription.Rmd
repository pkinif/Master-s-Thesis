# Data 

## Sample Selection

My database is a long panel data containing *n* companies, each of which includes *T* observations measured at 1 through *t* time period. As the same companies are observed for each period, I can describe my panel data as a fixed panel [@Greene2007].

Balanced or unbalanced panel data?
