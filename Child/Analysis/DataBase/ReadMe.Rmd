# Overview

This document aims at giving you an overview of my DataBase folders. This one is split up into several sub-folders :

## CAPM

This sub-folders contains :

i. the Fama and French 3 Factors (ie. Risk Free Rate and Return Market) collecting from http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/index.html on 18th April 2018 and,
ii. The "CAPM.csv" file which is the output of the *MakeFile_Capm.rmd*. 

The second file contains several variables :

 	
* Ra :	Compounded returns (i.e. log (1+r) with r equals the monthly return of the stock
* Rf :	Rf = Risk Free Rate 
* Rm : The Market Return
* Beta :	Beta of the CAPM 
* AlphaJensen	: Jensen's Alpha which had been calculated using the CAMP 3 factors, namely : AlphaJensen = (Ra - Rf) - Beta * (Rm - Rf) 
* CostEquity :	Cost of Equity calculated with the CAPM as CostEquity = Rf + Beta * (Rm-Rf)

All data are on a monthly based.
