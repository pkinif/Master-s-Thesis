# Literature Review


## Two perspectives on Corporate Environmental Performance

The paradigm of profit maximization of @MiltonFriedman1970 have been widely challenged these last decades. Whereas @MiltonFriedman1970 considers investment in pollution efficient technology as deviation from the wealth maximization goal, the literature is showing growing evidences that improving a company's environmental performance can lead to better economic or financial performance, and not necessarily to an increase in cost. @Ambec2008 have demonstrated that the expenses incurred to reduce pollution can be partly or completely offset by gains made elsewhere. @Porter1995 argued that rather than simply adding to cost, properly crafted environmental standards can trigger innovation offsets, allowing companies to improve their resource productivity. He even redefined the self concept of value creation in advocating that the solution lies in the principle of shared value which involves creating economic value in a way that also creates value for society by addressing its needs and challenges [@Porter2011a, @Porter2011]. @Freeman1984 call to a radical rethinking of our model of the firm. According to him, companies have to consider their stakeholder, namely *"any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of an organisation's objectives"* (p.25) or else face negative confrontation from non-shareholder groups, which can lead to diminished shareholder value, through boycotts, lawsuits and protests etc. In other words,  @Freeman1984 summarizes the idea that companies should consider corporate environmental performance as unavoidable cost of doing business.


## Does it pay to be green?

While more and more companies are embracing this new paradigm and develop profitable business strategies that deliver tangible social benefits, others keep the old fashion way of @MiltonFriedman1970. This dichotomy have interested scholars and since they have sought to empirically answer the question, *"Does it pay to be green?"*. In a competitive business world, answering this question is crucial to provide a genuine economic justification to the new paradigm [@Ludecadedebatenexus2014]. Although results are mixed, the large quantity of studies on the nexus between Corporate Environmental Performance (i.e. CEP) and Corporate Financial Performance (i.e. CFP) in the last two decades allowed the appearance of recent meta-analyses \footnote{Initially, the literature focused on the link between Corporate Social Performance (i.e. CSP) and Corporate Financial Performance (i.e. CFP). Orlitzky and Benjamin 2001 were the first to consider CEP as apart from CSP. Given that Busch and Friede 2018 could not detect statistically significant differences between the effects of environmental CEP and social-related CSP on CFP and concludes that good CSP pays off, whether social or environmental related, this study considers CSP equals to CEP.} [@Orlitzky2001, @Orlitzky2003, @Wu2006, @Albertini2013, @Dixon-Fowler2013, @EndrikatMakingsenseconflicting2014, @Ludecadedebatenexus2014, @WangMetaAnalyticReviewCorporate2016, @Busch2018] and all suggest that indeed it pays to be green. More precisely, a positive and bidirectional relationship does exist between CEP and CFP meaning that successful firms may have the resources necessary to improve their environmental performance, which in turn increases financial benefits that again can be invested back into further improvements of CEP [@EndrikatMakingsenseconflicting2014].



## CEP and CFP as a broad meta-construct

CFP is a broad meta-constructs and the current literature have shown that each construct play a moderator role in the relationship between CEP and CFP [@Orlitzky2003, @Ludecadedebatenexus2014, @Busch2018].Scholars have mainly adopted three broad subdivisions of CFP: market-based (investor returns), accounting-based (accounting returns), and perceptual (survey) measures. Market-based measures (e.g. price-earning ratio, Tobin's Q, or share price appreciation) consider that returns should be measured from the perspective of the shareholders [@Cochran1984a]. Accounting-based measures require profitability and asset utilization indicators such as Return on Asset (i.e. ROA) or Return on Equity (i.e. ROE) [@Cochran1984a, @Wu2006]. Finally perceptual measures of CFP is a more subjective approach based on the perception of survey respondents [@Ludecadedebatenexus2014]. 

CEP is also a broad meta-constructs and no common definition exist in the literature [@Albertini2013, @EndrikatMakingsenseconflicting2014]. Scholars have used a wide variety of indicators as proxies for approaching the green performance of companies. @Albertini2013 use a three-group classification to summarize CEP measures : (i) Environmental Management Measures (i.e. EMV) which mostly refer to environmental strategy, integration of environmental issues into strategic planning processes, environmental practices, process-driven initiatives, product-driven management systems, ISO 14001 certification, environmental management system adoption, and participation in voluntary programs [@Molina-Azorin2009, @Schultze2012]. (ii) Environmental Performance Variables (i.e. EPV) which are mostly measures quantified in physical units (carbon dioxide emissions, physical waste, water consumption, toxic release) that can be positive (emission reduction) or negative (emission generated) [@Albertini2013]. (iii) Environmental Disclosure Variables (i.e. EDV) such as information releases regarding toxic emission [@Hamilton1995], environmental awards [@Chencrosscountrycomparisongreen2018], environmental accidents and crises [@Blacconiere1994], and environmental investment announcements [@Gilley2000]. @EndrikatMakingsenseconflicting2014 split up CEP into two sub-dimensions, namely (i) process-based CEP which can be linked to the EMV approach of @Albertini2013 and (ii) outcome-based CEP which can be linked to the EPV dimension. According to @Xie2007, process-based CEP can be considered as a preliminary step of outcome-based CEP. Scholars demonstrated that the first approach have a positive impact on the second one which in turn has a positive impact on financial performance [@Li2017, @Chencrosscountrycomparisongreen2018]. 

Although recent recent meta-analyses [@Orlitzky2001, @Orlitzky2003, @Wu2006, @Albertini2013, @Dixon-Fowler2013, @EndrikatMakingsenseconflicting2014, @Ludecadedebatenexus2014, @WangMetaAnalyticReviewCorporate2016, @Busch2018] have demonstrated the positive link between CEP and CFP, some scholars advanced that the multidimensionality of both CEP and CFP constructs are one reason why the conclusion of the relationship between CEP and CFP have been so mixed [@Albertini2013, @EndrikatMakingsenseconflicting2014, @MiroshnychenkoGreenpracticesfinancial2017]. For instance, @Busch2011a  found that process-based CEP (in terms of carbon management) negatively affects CFP, while outcome-based CEP (in terms of carbon emissions) has a positive influence on CFP. @Cavaco2014 and @Muhammadrelationshipenvironmentalperformance2015 have used both accounting-based indicators (i.e. ROA) and market-based indicators (i.e. Tobin's Q) as a proxy for CFP and got a positive relation between ROA and CEP while no relation between Tobin's Q and CEP. A general consensus have shown that accounting-based CFP are characterized by a stronger relation to CEP than market-based and perceptual indicators [@Orlitzky2003, @Wu2006, @Albertini2013, @Ludecadedebatenexus2014, @Busch2018]. 


## When does it pay to be green?

@Griffin1997 was the first to call for research that looks at the CEP-CFP relation over time. While scholars had been mainly answering the  question *"Does it pay to be green?"* some have recently tried to move forward and gained interest in answering the call of @Griffin1997 with the following question : *"When does it pay to be green?"* [@ManriqueAnalyzingEffectCorporate2017]. 

@Zhang2017 have shown that CEP has a negative relationship with short-term financial performance and a positive relationship with long-term CFP. @Delmas2015 observed that the more a firm decreases carbon emissions the more positive the investors perceptions of future market performance and the lower its short term financial performance. @SongCanenvironmentalmanagement2017 have shown that corporate environmental management has a significant positive correlation with future financial performance, however it has no significant correlation with current financial performance. @ManriqueAnalyzingEffectCorporate2017 demonstrated that in times of economic crisis firms which improve their corporate environmental performance improve their corporate financial performance, this effect being weaker for firms in developed countries, where only the short-term corporate financial performance improves, than for firms in emerging and developing countries, where the short- and long-term corporate financial performance improve. @Chencrosscountrycomparisongreen2018 have shown that a firms green performance not only impact an organization's financial performance in that particular year but also impact the year that follows.

Those empirical results provide evidences that no common consensus have be found yet to answer the question *"When does it pay to be green?"*. @Busch2018 demonstrated that at a meta-research level, the evidence of a time dependency on the CEP-CFP link is not significant and that the call of @Griffin1997 remains to date unanswered. 

To capture the time dimension in the CFP-CEP nexus, scholars consider accounting-based measures as a proxy for short-term CFP and market-based measures as a proxy for long-term CFP [@EndrikatMakingsenseconflicting2014, @Delmas2015, @Zhang2017, @ManriqueAnalyzingEffectCorporate2017, @MiroshnychenkoGreenpracticesfinancial2017]. Indeed @EndrikatMakingsenseconflicting2014 highlitht that on the one hand, accounting-based measures capture immediate impacts but do not seize long-term effects unlike market-based measures which integrate estimations of a firm's future prospects and reflect the notion of external stakeholders.

Taking into account previous theoretical arguments and considering varying empirical findings with regards to the CEP-CFP nexus, this study hypothesizes the following :


**Hypothesis 1.** Process-based CEP have a positive impact on Outcome-based CEP

**Hypothesis 2.** Outcome-based CEP have a positive impact on short-term CFP

**Hypothesis 3.** Outcome-based CEP have a positive impact on long-term CFP

**Hypothesis 4.** Process-based CEP have a positive impact on short-term CFP

**Hypothesis 5.** Process-based CEP have a positive impact on long-term CFP
