  abstract = {The scale of environmental problems, coupled with social inequalities and competitiveness challenges within the global economy, have raised increasing awareness of the need to change and renew existing technological production and social behavioural patterns. At best, such awareness may produce innovative responses that gradually move society along a more sustainable path. Analytical tools for such transformation have been developed in the field of environmental management, namely within frameworks such as eco-efficiency,1 industrial ecology2 and design for environment3 and more recently within the concept of eco-effectiveness,4 natural capital and biomimicry.5 Furthermore, the urgency for change has led to increasing application of the term `innovation' in environmental management and policy. Despite the promise of eco-innovations, the term is also used in diverse contexts with different underlying connotations that may eventually diminish its practical value. Most commonly eco-innovation refers to new technologies that improve economic and environmental performance but also some definitions include organizational and social changes for improving competitiveness and sustainability and its social, economic and environmental pillars (see Box 2.1).},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide a critical review of the literature on the econometric analyses of firm-level determinants to eco-innovation. The review reveals some gaps in knowledge. First, an integrated theoretical framework which merges the insights from different approaches is missing. Second, the influence of some variables is still unsettled (demand-pull and cost-savings), whereas others have hardly been included in previous analyses (internal and international factors). Third, studies on the drivers to eco-innovation versus general innovation are relatively scarce with respect to those on the drivers to eco-innovation in general. Fourth, analyses of the relevance of different determinants to eco-innovation for distinct eco-innovator and eco-innovation types have largely been missing. Fifth, studies on middle-income and developing countries are still scarce. Sixth, the econometric analyses have relied on microeconometric methods based on cross-section data (mostly logit and probit models), whereas the use of panel data is virtually absent. Seventh, detailed econometric analyses on the distinct drivers and barriers to eco-innovation in different sectors and regions have not been performed so far. Finally, whether the position of the firm in the value chain and the market structure influence the propensity to eco-innovate are largely unexplored topics.},

Its main contribution lies in separating the drivers associated with the phases of development and diffusion and in identifying particular drivers based on different eco-innovation types. We find that research in this area primarily adopts the resource-based and institutional theories as its theoretical foundations and that the prevailing effects identified are those of regulations and market pull factors. Moreover, product eco-innovation, process eco-innovation, organizational eco-innovation, and environmental R\&amp;D investments seem to be driven by common drivers, such as regulations, market pull factors, EMS, and cost savings, as well as to be positively associated with company size. The majority of the studies in our literature review employ a quantitative research methodology and focus on the diffusion stage of eco-innovation. We end with providing a synthesis of drivers of companies' eco-innovation and directions for future research.},

While each type of innovation has its own attributes, determinants, and contribution to business performance, it is not effective to implement eco-innovation programs without a holistic view. This study draws from the resource-based view theory to investigate inter-relationships among three types of eco-innovation (process, product, organizational) and their relative impact on business performance. Using structural equation modeling with 121 samples collected from Taiwan Environmental Management Association, we find that eco-organizational innovation has the strongest effect on business performance. Additionally, eco-process and eco-product innovations partially mediate the effects of eco-organizational innovation, and eco-product innovation mediates eco-process innovations' effects on business performance. Business performance is directly and indirectly affected by eco-organizational, eco-process, and eco-product innovations. The findings suggest that, in order to develop effective eco-innovation programs, managers must understand the interdependence and co-evolutionary relationships between different types of eco-innovation. Overall, this study extends the discussion of innovation to the area of environmental innovation or eco-innovation.},

In this paper, we explore four types of eco-innovation (product, process, market and sources of supply) and their impact on accounting-based measurers of financial performance using the data on Polish and Hungarian publicly traded companies from the years 2006\textendash{}2013. Our results indicated that eco-innovators were generally characterized by higher returns on assets and equity and lower earnings retention. Additionally, companies that introduce eco-innovation were also significantly larger, more likely to face lower financial risk exposure and more likely to possess greater free cash flow than conventional firms. The findings suggest that strong asset and financial capabilities are relevant pre-conditions for the development of eco-innovativeness and that there is a need for environmental policy to create clear incentives for SMEs to increase activities in that area. Overall, this study extends the understanding of financial performance implications of innovation by focussing on the area of environmental innovation.},

Rewards or punishments (whether material or image-related) create doubt about the true motive for which good deeds are performed, and this "overjustification effect" can induce a partial or even net crowding out of prosocial behavior by extrinsic incentives. We also identify the settings that are conducive to multiple social norms and, more generally, those that make individual actions complements or substitutes, which we show depends on whether stigma or honor is (endogenously) the dominant reputational concern. Finally, we analyze the socially optimal level of incentives and how monopolistic or competitive sponsors depart from it. Sponsor competition is shown to potentially reduce social welfare.},

  abstract = {Abstract Considering the highlighted significance of understanding why and how companies integrate environmental sustainability into innovation process, it is important to question: How has the business literature researched `eco-innovation' related to the drivers that boost companies' adoption? What are the drivers and motivation for companies' adoption of eco-innovation? How could results from the literature help define a conceptual framework of eco-innovation drivers and motivations? To address these questions, a systematic review was conducted. After defining inclusion and exclusion search criteria, the search of peer reviewed papers from the \{ISI\} Web of Knowledge database was systematically applied. The final database included 96 full papers, of which 35 matched the specific target of analysis that focused at: i) Eco-innovation concepts and approaches; ii) Methods and main findings; and iii) Drivers and motivation for adoption of eco-innovation. Results indicated that there is a growing interest in this concept, not only from a managerial but also from an academic perspective (54\% of papers were published after 2010). Various methods are used in the selected papers, and evidence shows that leading firms are protagonists in developing new technologies. Although specific or one-off actions was enough to recognize eco-innovation in some cases, to boost performance companies need to improve the focus in eco-innovation as an explicit goal of their strategies. This paper contributes by pointing out internal factors that companies can manage in order to fully adopt eco-innovation, going beyond mere compliance of external factors over which companies have little or no control. Based on the systematic review, this article draws propositions and develops a conceptual model for further empirical research on eco-innovation.},

The Community Innovation Survey (CIS 2008) allows for an analysis of the determinants of eco-innovation in 19 different European countries. This paper focuses on Eastern Europe as the determinants of eco-innovation have not yet been systematically analyzed for these countries. Concerning the introduction of eco-innovations, this analysis shows that regulation activities and environmentally related subsidies seem to be more important for the Eastern countries than they are for the ``richer'' Western European countries. Furthermore, the Eastern European countries rely more on competitors and external R\&amp;D as information sources, indicating a technology transfer from West to East.},

We find that companies with balanced financial, social and environmental activities had lower revenues growth, lower growth volatility and lower stock price volatility. These results are consistent with the idea that companies benefit from investing in corporate sustainability and that these practices are reflected in their stock prices. The results also indicate that investment in sustainable companies does not show anti-cyclical patterns within the usual stock market cycle, but it is connected with higher stock market crash resistance. The empirical evidence from this paper is particularly pronounced for public companies that consider implementing sustainability into their core business strategy.

First, an integrated conceptual framework which takes into account the interplay between relevant variables influencing environmental technological change (i.e., factors internal and external to the firm and characteristics of the environmental technologies) and all the stages of this process, with a greater emphasis on the invention stage, should be developed. Other aspects should then be tackled, including a focus on several themes (i.e., a greater attention to cross-sectoral technologies, the barriers to different types of environmental technologies, the international dimension of environmental technological change and environmental technological change in small and medium size enterprises), methodological issues (combination of case studies and econometric modelling) and several issues related to the environmental policy variable.},

  abstract = {While innovation processes toward sustainable development (eco-innovations) have received increasing attention during the past years, theoretical and methodological approaches to analyze these processes are poorly developed. Against this background, the term eco-innovation is introduced in this paper addressing explicitly three kinds of changes towards sustainable development: technological, social and institutional innovation. Secondly, the potential contribution of neoclassical and (co-)evolutionary approaches from environmental and innovation economics to eco-innovation research is discussed. Three peculiarities of eco-innovation are identified: the double externality problem, the regulatory push/pull effect and the increasing importance of social and institutional innovation. While the first two are widely ignored in innovation economics, the third is at the least not elaborated appropriately. The consideration of these peculiarities may help to overcome market failure by establishing a specific eco-innovation policy and to avoid a `technology bias' through a broader understanding of innovation. Finally, perspectives for a specific contribution of ecological economics to eco-innovation research are drawn. It is argued that methodological pluralism as established in ecological economics would be very beneficial for eco-innovation research. A theoretical framework integrating elements from both neoclassical and evolutionary approaches should be pursued in order to consider the complexity of factors influencing innovation decisions as well as the specific role of regulatory instruments. And the experience gathered in ecological economics integrating ecological, social and economic aspects of sustainable development is highly useful for opening up innovation research to social and institutional changes.},

  abstract = {It is widely accepted that eco-innovation is the direction to make progress towards a sustainable innovation. Public and private actors seem to share a common point of view and agreement on the benefits of implementing eco-innovation. If this is the case, why eco-innovative activities are still exceptional and exemplary instead of being the usual reasoning and inspiring driver for all kind of actions? Going in depth into the reasons why eco-innovation techniques are not broadly spread, the main one is the lack of internalization of this attitude in all the everyday actions taken by companies and employees in the form of social responsibility. Definitively, society as a whole is responsible for the eco-innovation promotion. Large companies have long ago incorporated Social Responsibility into their strategic planning and invest on innovation as a competitive advantage. However, they are reluctant to contribute to the eco-innovation. Therefore, universities and technology centers (TCs) have to play this role and link the private sector, specially medium, and small size companies, with the society needs. However, Universities are not often leading the eco-innovation initiative. Currently, in the case of Spain, it is observed a huge gap between the scientific research efforts made by the Public University and the academic offering and the real needs of the private companies. In fact, mixed structures as TCs are needed in order to overcome this disconnection, increasing opportunities for subsequent cooperation in eco-innovation projects. This paper points out the causes of the Spanish R\&D and innovation lag, and highlights the reasons of the disconnection between public and private research for innovation, while giving hints on what is working fine and what needs to be reviewed to catch up with the R\&D reference countries in Europe.},

The present paper tries to close this gap by employing a new and unique dataset based on the German Community Innovation Survey, conducted in 2009. The main purpose of this paper is to test whether different types of eco-innovation (according to their environmental impacts) are driven by different factors. Beside a complex set of different supply, firm-specific, and demand factors, the literature on determinants of eco-innovation accentuates the important role of regulation, cost savings and customer benefits. We find that current and expected government regulation is particularly important with regard to pushing firms to reduce air (e.g. CO2, SO2 or NOx) as well as water or noise emissions, avoid hazardous substances, and increase recyclability of products. Cost savings are an important motivation for reducing energy and material use, pointing to the role of energy and raw material prices as well as taxation as drivers for eco-innovation. Customer requirements are another important source of eco-innovations, particularly with regard to products with improved environmental performance and process innovations that increase material efficiency, and reduce energy consumption, waste and the use of dangerous substances. Firms confirm a high importance of expected future regulations for all environmental product innovations.},

Albeit the design dimension is decisive to determine the environmental impacts of the innovation, all dimensions can play a significant role in the management of eco-innovation.

  title = {Eco-Innovation - Putting the {{EU}} on the Path to a Resource and Energy Efficient Economy},
  url = {https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19939/},
  abstract = {The objective of this study is to support the European Parliament's ITRE Committee in its work on the EU's industrial and energy policy and to give advice on the following issues: Why is the issue of resource scarcity back on the agenda? What are the strategic conclusions
for the EU? What can the EU expect from eco-innovation in a large range of industrial sectors? Are existing measures meeting the EU aims and expectations, and what new policy initiatives should be set forward? To meet these objectives, this study is structured as follows: Chapter 2 will give an overview on resource scarcities. Chapter 3 elaborates on ecoinnovation, including trends, barriers and driving forces. Chapter 4 outlines proposals for future
EU policies. Chapter 5 sketches out a possible vision for the future. Chapter 2 reveals recent findings on resource scarcity: Global extraction of natural resource is steadily increasing. Since 1980, global extraction of abiotic (fossil fuels, minerals) and biotic (agriculture, forestry, fishing) resources has augmented from 40 to 58 billion tonnes in 2005. Scenarios anticipate a total resource extraction of around 80 billion tonnes in 2020 (200 \% of the 1980-value), necessary to sustain the worldwide economic growth. On average, a European consumes per year around three times the amount of resources of a citizen in the emerging countries while producing twice as much.
Analysis on patterns of current resource use (direct and indirect use) is still in its infancy and shows data gaps. Based on country studies, however, one can arrive at tentative conclusions. A recent study on Germany reveals that ten production sectors account for more than 50 \% of
German Total Material Requirements (TMR). Industries of three areas are of strategic importance because here a huge number of technological interactions among production sectors take place:

\textbullet{} Stones, construction, and housing = housing

\textbullet{} Metals and car manufacturing = mobility

\textbullet{} Agriculture, food and nutrition = food.

The rapidly increasing demand for resources has led to an unprecedented boost in resource prices, especially during the last five years until the breakout of the financial crisis in Fall 2008. The EU is the world region that outsources the biggest part of resource extraction.
In comparison to the overall global growth rate (45 \% over the last 25 years), Europe's resource extraction grew only by 3 \%, but studies show that these domestic raw materials are increasingly substituted by imports from other world regions. World reserves in fossil fuels and metals are unevenly distributed across the world regions.
Additionally, for various commodities, the peak of extraction has already been reached or is currently about to be reached. Not only for oil and gas, but also for critical metals such as Antimon, Gallium, Indium, Platinum and others the supply for European industry is at risk.
Natural gas cannot replace oil as main energy source, once the latter is depleted. From this, the following main conclusions are derived:

\textbullet{} The European economy is increasingly dependent on resource imports from other world regions.

\textbullet{} Scarcity of `Critical metals' will affect the European economy more subtle, but furtherreaching.

High-tech industries, in particular the electronic industry, will be affected by deWuppertal Institute et al. Eco-Innovation iv clining availability of precious metals. Also the development of new eco-technologies, such as photovoltaic electricity generation, could be slowed down by resource scarcity. 

\textbullet{} It can be expected that worldwide competition for these resources will significantly increase in the near future, potentially leading to serious conflicts related to the access to resource reserves.

\textbullet{} In order to deal with this increased scarcity of natural resources, a significant reduction of the worldwide resource use will be necessary.

Chapter 3 gives a definition of eco-innovation as well as an overview of different types of eco-innovation and deals with measurement issues. Furthermore, it illustrates selected ecoinnovations in key areas, and highlights also trends, drivers and barriers analysed for these
examples and illustrated by fishbone diagrams. The scrutinised eco-innovations and the regarding
key conclusions are

(1) In the area of housing

a. ``Deep Renovation'', which enables a minimisation of negative impacts on environment and health by system design and choice of components and is possible in nearly every building, though standardisation is limited, and

b. ``Smart Metering'', for which there is worldwide evidence that giving consumers appropriate, relevant information on their energy and water use is an important basis for additional measures leading to a reduction in this use and thus in GHG emissions.

(2) In the area of mobility

a. the ``Green Electric Car'' and

b. ``Car sharing'';

(3) In the area of food and drink

(a) the ``Community Supported Agriculture'' (CSA) and

(b) ``Sustainable Sourcing of Retailers''.

The chapter concludes that eco-innovation has a crucial role to play in putting the EU on the
path to a resource and energy efficient economy and thus significantly reducing the environmental
impacts in each of the areas, housing, mobility and food and drink. Experts estimate
that this is likely to become an \$800 billion market worldwide by 2015 and a \$ trillion
market afterwards.
Overcoming the barriers and building up eco-industries for energy and resource efficiency
however calls for an active European Union. It requires the engagement of many different
actors in society, and strategies should be implemented from many different sides. For an ecoinnovation
to be fully accepted and diffused into wider society, a concerted effort must be
made to engage people and target the emotional and psychological aspects required to reinforce
its uptake.

Chapter 4 (How to speed up eco-innovation in the EU) undertakes an attempt to analyse existing
EU policies and initiatives; selected member states' efforts are also considered. This is
done via a comparative methodology with a joint format. The annex to this study contains
three further briefing notes on this issue written by other authors. The following policies, initiatives
and instruments are considered in this study:

\textbullet{} The Eco-design Directive (2005/32/EU) \textendash{} focuses on energy use for a number of
products and neglects other environmental dimensions, functional innovation and
system innovation are not yet covered;
Wuppertal Institute et al. Eco-Innovation v

\textbullet{} The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) \textendash{} first experience
suggests a bias in favour of recycling technologies and energy along existing technology
trajectories, less visibility of resource efficiency and new pathways;

\textbullet{} The Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development
(FP7);

\textbullet{} The Environmental Technology Action Plan (ETAP) \textendash{} Despite many achievements, environmental technologies still remain a niche market; further green procurement, greater financial investments, the establishment of technology verification and performance targets systems, and focussing on sectors with high gains is needed;

The analysis identifies specific gaps in the areas of entrepreneurship, pre-commercialisation
and mass market development; in addition, the opportunities to refurbish buildings in Europe
have not fully been deployed yet (see Figure 1). Based on this and supported by an expert
workshop conducted by the ITRE on 12 November 08, the study formulates proposals that
could support the EU to speed up eco-innovation. They promote market-based incentives and
the reform of existing initiatives; in addition, new proposals are presented that address specific
gaps in the areas of entrepreneurship, pre-commercialisation as well as the opportunities
to refurbish buildings in Europe.
Bearing in mind the importance of construction as a driving forces of resource use, the relevance
of the construction industry in the EU Lead market Strategy and current deficits, and
the overall success of market-based instruments, this study proposes to extend the existing
eco-tax base in Europe by establishing a minimum tax directive on construction minerals.
It is expected to drive up eco-innovation because it gives incentives to improve resource efficiency
and to refurbish old buildings. In addition, it generates revenues, which can be utilized
for specific eco-innovation programmes.
A greening of the EU budget would be the material basis for speeding up eco-innovation
beyond 2009. This would have to follow two strategic lines: on the one hand unsustainable
spending would have to be cut, on the other hand the money saved by this activity could be
shifted to support investments in structural eco-innovation. A budgetary strategy could include
the following elements:

\textbullet{} Further redirecting CAP from direct payments towards integrated rural development schemes, which support eco-innovation in the area of sustainable production of highquality food and biomass. These integrated rural development schemes should include integrated logistical, economic and technological strategies for adapted sustainable natural resource management in the landscape (food, water, soil, biodiversity and closed-loop biomass production and use). These strategies would have to
be highly adapted to local economies and landscape conditions thus inducing local eco-innovation and employment schemes. Wuppertal Institute et al. Eco-Innovation vi

\textbullet{} Rigorous environmental appraisal and reduction of Regional Policy schemes for
large infrastructure projects which could support long-term unsustainable development
paths, shifting towards funding for eco-innovation e.g. in the area of decentralized
electricity grids (supporting green electric cars and renewable energies) and
lighthouse projects on resource efficient construction and resource recovery.

\textbullet{} Redirection of Regional Funds from end-of-pipe technologies towards integrated solutions
and eco-innovation (e.g. decentralized water treatment)

\textbullet{} More advanced schemes for improving energy and material productivity of economies
would require an implementation of the CREST guidelines for improved coordination
between Structural Funds, the Research Framework Program and the
Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP). Only such a concentration of
forces could achieve a measurable improvement of resource productivity in Europe
by means of regional eco-innovation clusters and a European network of regional resource
efficiency agencies.

\textbullet{} Integration spending of the European Investment Bank (EIB) for improved cofinancing
of eco-innovation
Figure 1: Gaps of current EU programmes on eco-innovation
Engaging industry in developing eco innovation for sustainable ways of living is considered
to be essential. The study identifies six strategy areas where industry can act:

1. Strategy Area 1: Creating and satisfying demand for green and fair products

2. Strategy Area 2: Communicating for low impact product use

3. Strategy Area 3: Innovative after sales services

4. Strategy Area 4: Product and service innovations
Wuppertal Institute et al. Eco-Innovation vii

5. Strategy Area 5: Service-oriented business models

6. Strategy Area 6: Leadership for social change and socially responsible business

The study formulates proposals to strengthen the SCP Action Plan accordingly, with a special
focus on a framework for smarter consumption and leaner production. green public procurement
and international processes.
Following the gaps identified above, the study also proposes to establish three new initiatives:

\textbullet{} A European Trust Funds for Eco-Entrepreneurship, intended to support system
innovation driven by new companies;

\textbullet{} A Technology Platform for Resource-light industries, intended to develop new
markets for European manufacturing industries;

\textbullet{} A Programme to foster energy and resource efficiency in the building sector, intended
to foster

\textbullet{} The deployment of existing opportunities in that area.
Finally, a few thoughts are given to the international dimension of eco-innovation and a possible
vision of an eco-innovative Europe.},

The experience gained in five developing countries allows to better investigate the ways whereby the financial community could, and perhaps should, more effectively promote financing of CP, thus contributing to the spread of the CP concept and measures at the macro (government), medium (industry associations, chambers of commerce) and micro (enterprises) levels. In doing so, the paper indirectly emphasises the role of other key stakeholders.

  abstract = {The notion of sustainable development, which is currently being proposed as the panacea to many of the most pressing environmental problems, reflects the environmental movement's ambivalent relationship to scientific knowledge: on the one hand, science is used to legitimize the `green case'; on the other, it is seen as responsible for many of the current environmental problems. Local, or traditional, knowledge is often proposed as a superior form of knowledge as it lies outside science and is seen as representing a closer affinity with `nature'. However, local knowledge, like scientific knowledge, can be reified, given virtues it simply does not possess. In this paper we examine the two categories of scientific and local knowledge. Using the work of sociologists of science such as Bruno Latour, we show that science is not different to local knowledge because it has a superior access to `reality' but because it is more powerful, i.e. it is able to act over greater distances. We then draw upon anthropological work on the use of local knowledge in traditional agriculture to show that this system of knowledge is often `scientific' but is more intimately related to local environments. However, local knowledge is not always in `harmony' with such environments and can result in serious degradation. It should not, therefore, be counterposed as a `greener' alternative to scientific knowledge. Rather, as with science itself, local knowledge should be investigated in `action'. We conclude with a call for a new social science approach to the relationship between nature and culture and the local and universal which stresses `hybridity' i.e. the extent to which these categories are inextricably mixed.},

We study the relationship of complementarity between strategies of High Performance Work Practices (HPWP) and Human Resource Management (HRM) when EI adoption is the firms' objective, using an original dataset on 555 Italian industrial firms regarding EI, HPWP and HRM, coherent with the last CIS2006-2008 survey. Results show that sector specificity matter. The only case in which strict complementarity is observed in organisational change concerns CO2 abatement, a relatively complex type of EI, but this is true only when the sample is restricted to more polluting (and regulated) sectors. This evidence is coherent with the Porter hypothesis: complementarity-related adoption of EI is an element of organisational change in firms that are subject to more stringent environmental regulations. Nevertheless, the fact that strict complementarity is not a diffuse factor behind the adoption of all environmental innovation indeed does not come as a surprise. At this stage in the development of green strategies, the share of eco-firms is still limited, even in advanced countries that are seeking tools for a new competitiveness. The full integration of EIs within the internal capabilities and firm's own assets is far from being reached, even in advanced and competitive industrial settings.},

An important argument in the public debate is also the creation of new markets for environmentally benign products, processes and services in other countries and the generation, as a result, of export opportunities for the pioneering country (lead markets). Research on lead markets has not, however, focused on environmental innovations to date. We therefore extend the lead market model to environmental innovations and take particular account of the peculiarities of such innovations, in particular, the public good character of environmental benefits and the role of regulations. This approach is applied to two case studies: wind energy and fuel-efficient passenger cars. In both cases, the innovation was initially adopted in one country. Other countries subsequently adopted the same innovation design favored by the lead market which, in turn, developed into a large exporter in the wind generation and car industries, respectively. We discuss the regulations employed and the reasons for the international success of the innovations induced by them. Our findings demonstrate that when supported by global demand or regulatory trends, strict regulation results in the creation of lead markets. Finally, we provide recommendations on how our model could be used for further research and in the development of a coordinated environmental and innovation policy.},

  abstract = {Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent a key vector to introduce and diffuse eco-innovation in the market, because of their relevance to both the environment and the European gross domestic product. As they are often focused on continuous and incremental innovation of their products, the optimization of product eco-innovation paths can be considered a central aspect of their business. All phases of this process (awareness building and training, analysis, product (re)design and communication/certification) need to be supported to overcome the existing barriers, which mainly consist of lack of experience inside SMEs and cost of information, data, and tools. Information and Communication Technologies can play a role to lower some of the barriers, but currently the numerous services and tools available cover only specific aspects of the whole process, and are often too complex for their direct use by SMEs. The multilingual web-based platform Ecosmes.net here presented aims to integrate user-friendly and free-of-charge services and tools to support all phases of the product eco-innovation process in SMEs. The approach behind mainly consists in developing tailored, simplified tools, and in carrying out ``homogeneous product group'' studies, as a basis for the production of pre-elaborated information and data to be used with the tools developed. Experience gained in 5 years of applications has confirmed that Ecosmes.net can facilitate the start-up of the product eco-innovation process, but has also shown that not all the potentialities have been fully exploited. Moreover, as the eco-innovation market is not developed enough to allow economic management of these kinds of online services, a public initiative is advocated to face this challenge and support a continuous upgrading. Modes and opportunities are proposed and discussed in the conclusion.},

Interesting specifications for these results are found for particular kinds of EIs, in such fields as CO2 abatement and ISO labelling, generally extending the analysis of EI drivers by joining local and international factors.

The econometric estimations, controlling for selection bias, suggest that environmental innovative firms cooperate on innovation with external partners to a higher extent than other innovative firms. Furthermore, cooperation with suppliers, KIBS and universities is more relevant than for other innovators, whereas cooperation with clients does not seem to be differentially important. Finally, the results bespoke of a substitution effect between cooperation activities and the internal R\&amp;D effort.},

The conceptual framework is applied to the case of the French automotive industry, with a specific focus on the development of low emission vehicles. The analysis shows how technological regime and demand conditions lead to technological inertia, and so to a strong persistence of the dominant design. Finally, environmental and innovative policy are considered in an integrated way, so that we can study how they influence technological regime and demand conditions, and in the meantime how they are conditioned by these two blocks.},

  abstract = {Environmental modernization of the economy includes the implementation of environmental policies which connect environmental management to technical environmental innovations and improved economic performance. Some of the most important instruments in this respect are standards for environmental management systems such as the EU Environmental Management and Auditing Scheme (EMAS). Based on a unique data set of German EMAS-validated facilities, this paper investigates the effects of different characteristics of EMAS on technical environmental innovations and economic performance. Most firms report a positive influence of environmental management systems in general on environmental process innovations. Furthermore, environmental reports support the diffusion of technical environmental innovations. The econometric analysis shows a positive impact of the maturity of environmental management systems on environmental process innovations. Another important determinant of environmental process innovations is the strong participation of specific departments in the further development of EMAS such as the R\&amp;D department. For environmental product innovations, learning processes by environmental management systems have a positive impact. Such learning processes as well as environmental process innovations also have a positive influence on economic performance. We conclude that a careful design of EMAS is important for both the environmental and economic performance of a facility.

Using a novel firm-level dataset from a DEFRA survey, we estimate a Tobit model, which provides empirical evidence showing that these eco-innovations are motivated by different external policy tools and internal firm specific factors. Our findings indicate that End of Pipeline Technologies and Integrated Cleaner Production Technologies are mainly driven by equipment upgrade motives with a view of improving efficiency while environmental regulations are effective in stimulating the End-of-Pipeline technologies and Environmental R\&amp;D. Interestingly, alongside government induced regulations, we find that market factors, mainly motivated by cost savings, are effective in driving Environmental R\&amp;D. Finally, ISO14001 certification is effective in strengthening the positive impact of environmental management systems on both End-of-Pipeline technologies and Environmental R\&amp;D while CSR policies have no significant impact on motivating any of the eco-innovations.},

  abstract = {The environmental economics literature emphasises the key role that environmental regulations play in stimulating eco-innovations. Innovation literature, on the other hand, underlines other important determinants of eco-innovations, mainly the supply-side factors such as firms' organisational capabilities and demand-side mechanisms, such as customer requirements and societal requirements on corporate social responsibility (CSR). This paper brings together the views of these different disciplines and provides empirical insights on the drivers of eco-innovations based on a novel dataset of 1566 UK firms that responded to the Government Survey of Environmental Protection Expenditure by Industry in 2006. By applying the Heckman selection model, our findings indicate that demand factors affect the decision of the firm to undertake eco-innovations whilst these factors exhibit no impact upon the level of investments in eco-innovations. Hence, we suggest that firms initiate eco-innovations in order to satisfy the minimum customer and societal requirements, yet, increased investments in eco-innovations are stimulated by other factors such as cost savings, firms' organisational capabilities, and stricter regulations. Based on a quantile regression analysis, the paper offers interesting insights for policy makers, by showing that the stringency of environmental regulations affects eco-innovations of the less innovative firms differently from those of the more innovative firms.},

Hence, this paper aims to bridge this gap by providing empirical evidence to encourage companies to implement green supply chain and green innovation in order to improve their environmental performance, and to enhance their competitive advantage in the global market. A model is constructed to link the aforementioned constructs. Data were collected through a questionnaire-based survey across 124 companies from eight industry sectors in Taiwan. The data are analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling and the results from the final measurement model are used to evaluate the structural model that verifies the significance of the proposed relationships. A prominent result of this study is that greening the supplier through green innovation contributes significant benefits to the environmental performance and competitive advantage of the firm.},

The research presented in this paper draws on Abrahamson's theoretical framework of fads and fashions to argue that dimensions of uncertainty and degree of external versus internal influence provide significant insights into firms' decisions to adopt sustainable building innovations. We develop three hypotheses, reflecting three views of adoption influence: fad, fashion, and efficient-choice. We find that adoption of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building certification in the United States was more likely among firms similarly oriented toward end-consumers and among firms strategically positioned as environmental leaders. These results provide support for the fad and efficient-choice views of adoption, respectively. Contrary to expectations suggested by the fashion perspective, adoption was not more likely among firms located in states whose political leaders are more committed to environmental protection. Our findings offer important implications for practitioners and policy makers seeking to encourage sustainable building design.

This paper describes how Philips uses this approach in its Green Flagship Program (GFP). Philips' GFP is particularly interesting since it sets specific targets across all its business units, thus driving the integration of sustainability innovation into its core business. This study suggests that the impact of sustainability innovations can be improved by focusing on sustainability as an explicit goal as well as processes and projects instead of merely concentrating on content and structure.

Until recently these programmes have focused almost exclusively on consumer (retail) packaging, but increasingly companies are starting to address the environmental impacts of industrial packaging. This is being driven as much by regulation as it is by the need to reduce costs and increase efficiency in supply chains. This paper argues that environmental innovation in industrial packaging systems requires a cooperative supply chain approach to ensure that environmental and commercial costs are reduced and efficiencies optimized for the chain as a whole. This is based on a review of the literature and an industrial packaging supply chain research and demonstration programme conducted between 2003 and 2005 in Australia.},

  abstract = {This article reports results of a 1993 questionnaire survey of how UK companies have been innovating technologically in response to environmental pressures. The survey sought to identify factors stimulating UK firms to innovate more environmentally friendly products and processes, and to investigate the changes in R\&D activity they have undertaken to facilitate such innovation. In devising the questionnaire and interpreting the results, we have been strongly influenced by the theoretical frameworks developed over the past 15 years which describe technological developments in terms of `selection environments' and `technological trajectories'. Useful though such frameworks are, we conclude that they need to be supplemented by concepts derived from the sociology of technology and from studies of corporate strategies.},

The environmental adaptations made by this industrial sector were not merely the result of a corporate initiative or of the response by firms or industries to environmental regulation. An examination of the innovation-system approach that was used to further the industry's environmental goals reveals that the knowledge and technology development underpinning the project depended on a network of diverse actors. Within this network, the semi-governmental Institute for Water and Air Protection, working with a consulting company, was a critical generator and intermediary of knowledge. Thus, the success of the project was largely due to the Institute's balanced relations with government and industry.},

  abstract = {There is increasing scientific evidence that natural systems are now at a level of stress globally that could have profound negative effects on human societies worldwide. In order to avoid these effects, one, or a number of technological transitions will need to take place through transforming processes of eco-innovation, which have complex political, institutional and cultural, in addition to technological and economic, dimensions. Measurement systems need to be devised that can assess to what extent eco-innovation is taking place. Environmental and eco-innovation have already led in a number of European countries to the establishment of substantial eco-industries, but, because of the general absence of environmental considerations in markets, these industries are very largely the result of environmental public policies, the nature and effectiveness of which have now been assessed through a number of reviews and case studies. The paper concludes that such policies will need to become much more stringent if eco-innovation is to drive an adequately far-reaching technological transition to resolve pressing environmental challenges. Crucial in the political economy of this change will be that eco-industries, supported by public opinion, are able to counter the resistance of established industries which will lose out from the transition, in a reformed global context where international treaties and co-operation prevent the relocation of environmentally destructive industries and encourage their transformation.},

Drawing upon a database of 27 European countries, empirical evidence is found for the different roles of supply-side, demand-side and regulatory factors in encouraging the adoption of different types of eco-innovation. Our empirical strategy consists of the estimation of a trivariate probit model. Our results show that those entrepreneurs who give importance to collaboration with research institutes, agencies and universities, and to the increase of market demand for green products are more active in all types of eco-innovations. Supply-side factors seem to be a more important driver for environmental processes and organizational innovations than for environmental product innovations. The results also show that market share only has a significant positive influence on eco-product and eco-organizational innovations, while cost-savings are solely significant for eco-process innovations. Finally, prioritizing existing regulations shapes eco-product and eco-organizational innovations while expected regulations and access to subsidies and fiscal incentives do not have any significant effect on the decision to eco-innovate in Europe at the firm-level.},

  abstract = {Sustainable development has occupied a vital position in the field of service design. Since it requires the linkage between economic value and environmental benefits, how to organize service models with social networks becomes a key issue. Related studies generally focus on reducing cost and waste through product-based services; organizational activities and policy-oriented services are relatively ignored. In addition, few methods are adopted to generate service concepts with operational techniques or principles. Hence, ``feedback map'' and ``service flow modeling'' are proposed in this paper to help decision makers build appropriate service models. These tools are integrated with existing methods and knowledge, making a systematic framework to handle the information flows in service design.

A workshop with the experiment is carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The results indicate that this framework provides comprehensive information and guidance to fit service activities to sustainable development. It also improves the cooperation across profit and non-profit sectors and different knowledge domains, assisting planners in exploring more possibilities of service types. Moreover, it considers not only product development but also relative strategies or actions for sustainability. It appears that this approach is applicable to deal with complicated situations involving multiple service participants.},

As such, it is one of the first studies to go beyond the anecdotal evidence in the extant literature, to empirically research ENPD activities and their impacts. This contributes to the debate about the potential for firms to be ``green and competitive'' by examining the relationship between ENPD activities and market and eco-performance for environmental new products.

  abstract = {Chemical industries have the potential to become a driving force to introduce efficient production practices for reducing the negative impact on the environment. In order to meet these environmental challenges, innovation is a key factor in turning the concept of green growth into a reality through the development of eco-friendly technologies and sustainable production. Therefore, to accelerate and improve the design of eco-inventive solutions, new approaches must be created and adapted to integrate the constraints of eco-invention in the preliminary design. The purpose of this paper is to present the first elements of a computer aided eco-innovation system to support the engineers in preliminary design. This research paper proposes a method based on a synergy between the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) and the Case Based Reasoning. However, the typical level of abstraction of the TRIZ tools is modified. Indeed, TRIZ only gives way or guidelines to explore in order to find an inventive solution, which are often too abstract and hard to traduce into an inventive concept. To reduce this level of abstraction, this work proposes to apply the physical, chemical, biological, geometrical effects or phenomenon as solutions as they are more concrete. This is done thanks to a resources oriented search in order to better exploit the resources encompassed in the system. A case study on a new production process in chemical engineering illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

This paper reports the findings of research conducted as part of the SOLiD project which considered the transfer and application of the PSS concept from academia to industry in the United Kingdom. It draws upon theories from evolutionary economics to provide a rationale for the transfer of the PSS concept and the role of this in achieving desirable technological change. The paper also identifies an appropriate methodology to transfer the PSS concept from UK academic circles to industry and the factors which impact upon, and importantly lead to, the successful completion of this process. The combination of theoretical insight with case study research is used to develop a framework that could help UK based intermediaries to complete the transfer of the PSS concept.

Our results find partial support to the hypothesis that corporate social responsibility is a move from the shareholders wealth to a multi-stakeholders welfare target. On the one side, permanence into the domini index (DI) is shown to increase (reduce) significantly total sales per employee (returns on equity but not when large and R\&D investing firms are excluded from the sample). On the other side, lower returns on equity for Domini firms seem nonetheless to be accompanied by relatively lower conditional volatility and lower reaction to extreme shocks with respect to the control sample. An explanation for these findings, suggested by the inspection of Domini criteria, is that social responsibility implies, on the one side, decisions leading to higher cost of labour and of intermediate output, but may, on the other side, enhance involvement, motivation and identification of the workforce with company goals with positive effects on productivity.},

  abstract = {The conventional wisdom concerning environmental protection is that it comes at an additional cost imposed on firms, which may erode their global competitiveness. However, during the last decade, this paradigm has been challenged by a number of analysts (e.g., Porter \& van der Linde, 1995), who have argued basically that improving a company's environmental performance can lead to better economic or financial performance, and not necessarily to an increase in cost. The aim of this paper is to review empirical evidence of improvement in both environmental and economic or financial performance. We systematically analyze the mechanism involved in each of the following channels of potential revenue increase or cost reduction owing to better environmental practices: (a) better access to certain markets; (b) differentiating products; (c) selling pollution-control technology; (d) risk management and relations with external stakeholders; (e) cost of material, energy, and services; (f) cost of capital; and (g) cost of labor. In each case, we try to identify the circumstances most likely to lead to a "win-win" situation, i.e., better environmental and financial performance. We also provide a diagnostic of the type of firms most likely to reap such benefits. Copyright by the Academy of Management; all rights reserved.},

A content analysis of publicly available information from 24 Canadian corporations listed in the DJSI North America (DJSINA) showed that less than half of those sampled used the DJSI logo in their sustainability reports or on their websites. The majority of the published references to the DJSI were in highlighting corporate achievements or in providing background information on the index. A survey of 10 experts from the Canadian corporations listed in the DJSINA revealed a wide range of strategies for gaining and maintaining inclusion in the index, particularly involving a large number of internal stakeholders in responding to data requests and working with third parties. Several suggestions for improving the DJSI were also provided, including streamlining the questionnaire, improving coordination among sustainability ratings agencies, and enhancing transparency.},

  abstract = {As the social and environmental impacts of human activity have become more evident, the role of sustainable development as an organising principle in a variety of policy contexts and over multiple scales has become central. There are, at least, two implications that emerge from this observation. First, morally infused problems that need to be addressed have become more intractable, requiring innovation in our modes of thinking. Second, new spaces have emerged where the academy might explore how knowledge is created, validated and translated (or not) alongside policy and practice settings. One outcome of these trends has been the emergence of a stream of work (sustainability science) which investigates how disciplines might develop knowledge that progresses sustainable development. The aim of this paper, in line with the focus of the special issue, is to explore what possibilities emerge for accounting in light of a sustainability science approach. To achieve this end the paper starts with an exploration of the frustrations expressed in the literature over the perceived lack of progress made by social and environmental accounting towards addressing sustainable development. The paper then introduces sustainability science with the aim of imagining how an accounting for sustainable development might emerge. The paper closes with two illustrations of how a sustainability science approach to accounting could develop.},

We discuss the gestation and requirements of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) conceptual framework of 2013, suggesting that as finalised it has little relevance to either sustainability or ecology. Consistent with Luhmann's approach which praises for more consciousness, our research provides no instant blueprint or solution, but a coherent way of understanding and analysing the complex set of systems and sub-systems involved in the multi-capital, multi-measurement-unit, multi-stakeholder and multi-motivated current content of the sustainability issue. The paper suggests that the current field of operations may be too narrow. It provides a mental mechanism for creative forward thinking, establishing a broader framework and providing guidance and direction for this enlargement. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Especially in developing countries, the demand for new roads and maintenance of existing roads is very high as they depend on the overall economic development. These calls for transforming the methods the roads are being constructed. Recent studies have shed light on the concept of making transportation system greener and more sustainable, which can be a fast track to achievie the goals of saving the planet from further generations. One of the effective ways of addressing this issue is by substituting or replacing pavements layers by sustainable alternate materials. Promising alternate materials have been investigated in road construction-specifically using recycled wastes. The purpose of this study is to analyze the environmental significances of alternate materials such as recycled tires, recycled glass and waste plastics in road construction and delineate their economic and environmental importance. This is addressed by comparing various parameters such as global warming potential, carbon footprint, cost, and other environmental impact factors. The results of this investigation showed that the use of these materials in pavement construction has substantial environmental and economic benefits. These results will assist in developing revised pavement design and construction methods that are more efficient and economically feasible.},

While the debate on global and national carbon emission targets has dominated every major climate change conference, little is known about how the firms set emission targets. Using a dataset on S\&P 500 companies in the United States, we investigate the determinants of firm-level climate change mitigation targets, including target adoption and target metric (intensity target vs. absolute target). We find that companies with larger size, higher growth, better innovation, weaker capital constraint, and higher government pressure are more likely to establish emission targets. Further, firm growth has a negative (positive) and significant association with the use of absolute (intensity) target. This may be due to the fact that intensity target can better accommodate growth than absolute target. Policymakers and corporate managers may resort to those determinant factors in designing climate change policies to induce desirable firm-level target-setting behaviors.},

The purpose of this paper is to implement a fuzzy model to evaluate consumer behavior in relation to three pro-environmental practices that can be implemented at the household level, including reductions in resource consumption (reduce), reuse of resources (reuse), and recycling (recycle). To identify socio-demographic profiles that characterize an environmentally responsible consumer, 2831 surveys were applied on a representative sample of consumers residing in a Mexican city. Fuzzy logic and neural networks were applied using a Sugeno-type subtractive clustering to determine each profile. The model input variables were socioeconomic status, age, education level, monthly income, occupation and the type of organizations with which the consumer is affiliated. The output variables were represented by pro-environmental practices. Results show that the consumer practices are performed independently of each other, with the most frequent pro-environmental consumer practices being reduction and reuse.},

The case is presented of Azerbaijan, a vibrant, resource-rich Caucasian country which has demonstrated spectacular GDP growth only a few years into independence from the former Soviet Union. Using a single indicator, energy consumption for GDP production, in association with the classic Gini coefficient of economic equity, the authors argue empirically for renewed and innovative measurement of progress towards achievement of crucial United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.},

  abstract = {This qualitative study offers a novel exploration of the links between social media, virtual intergroup contact, and empathy by examining how empathy is expressed through interactions on a popular social media blog. Global leaders are encouraging individuals to engage in behaviors and support policies that provide basic social foundations. It is difficult to motivate people to undertake such actions. However, research shows that empathy intensifies motivation to help others. It can cause individuals to see the world from the perspective of stigmatized group members and increase positive feelings. Social media offers a new pathway for virtual intergroup contact, providing opportunities to increase conversation about disadvantaged others and empathy. We examined expressions of empathy within a popular blog, Humans of New York (HONY), and engaged in purposeful case selection by focusing on (1) events where specific prosocial action was taken corresponding to interactions on the HONY blog and (2) presentation of people in countries other than the United States. Nine overarching themes; (1) perspective taking, (2) fantasy, (3) empathic concern, (4) personal distress, (5) relatability, (6) prosocial action, (7) community appreciation, (8) anti-empathy, and (9) rejection of anti-empathy, exemplify how the HONY community expresses and shares empathic thoughts and feelings.},

In this paper, we discuss a way of understanding and representing RRI that resonates with private companies and lends itself to practical implementation and action. We propose the development of an RRI maturity model in the tradition of other well-established maturity models, linked with a corporate research and development (R\&amp;D) process. The foundations of this model lie in the discourse surrounding RRI and selected maturity models from other domains as well as the results of extensive empirical investigation. The model was tested in three industry environments and insights from these case studies show the model to be viable and useful in corporate innovation processes. With this approach, we aim to inspire further research and evaluation of the proposed maturity model as a tool for facilitating the integration of RRI in corporate management.},

Households can vote on whether the budgets they receive should only be spent on purchasing the sustainable product variety, or whether every household in a group is free to spend their budget on any product variety. By conducting several treatments, we tested whether people tend to view sustainable consumption as a social dilemma or as a moral dilemma. We find little support for the hypothesis that social dilemma considerations are the key drivers of sustainable consumption behaviour. Participants seem to be caught in a moral dilemma in which they not only weigh their individual financial costs with the sustainable benefits but they also consider the consequences of restricting other people's freedom of choice. Complementary survey results further substantiate this claim and show that many people are reluctant to impose restrictions on their peers, but, at the same time, our results also suggest substantial support for the government to regulate the availability of unsustainable product varieties.},

  abstract = {There have been many corporate collapses and financial crises in recent years linked to a lack of effective corporate governance. The South African King IV Code of Corporate Governance recommends that corporate governing bodies should be comprised of an appropriate balance of knowledge, diversity, and independence for discharging their duties objectively and more efficiently. This study examines the effect of corporate governance structures on firm financial performance. The secondary data of selected Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) Index-listed mining firms' sustainability reports, and integrated annual financial statements are used. Using panel data analysis of the random effects model, we determined the relationship between board independence and board size and the return on equity (ROE) for the period 2010\textendash{}2015. Results indicate a weak negative correlation between ROE and board size, and a weak, but positive, correlation between ROE and board independence. Additionally, there is a positive, but weak, correlation between ROE and sales growth, but a negative and weak relationship between ROE and firm size. The study suggests that effective corporate governance through a small effective board and monitoring by an independent board result in increased firm financial performance. We recommend that South African companies see compliance with the recommendations of the King IV Code on Corporate Governance not as a liability, but an ethical investment that may likely yield financial benefit in the long-term. Although complying with corporate governance principles does not necessarily translate into a significant economic benefit, firms should, however, continue to adopt corporate governance for ethical reasons to meet stakeholder's social and environmental needs for sustainable development.},

Researches show that emissions from the transport sector have been found to be a main source of air pollution in cities. Governments have implemented numerous green traffic policies to mitigate harmful emissions. However, the problem as to whether the green traffic policies are effective, and the extent to which the policies affect air quality remain unknown. This paper is the first attempt to apply a difference-in-difference method to investigate how a specific green traffic policy (in our case, the green traffic pilot cities program) affects air quality. The estimates show that the pilot program is associated with consistent reductions in annual concentration of pollutants. In pilot cities of China, the annual concentration of     SO 2    ,     NO 2     and     PM 10     decrease by 10.71 percent, 11.26 percent and 9.85 percent, respectively, after the implementation of the green traffic pilot cities program. The results show that the green traffic pilot has a noticeable improvement on air quality of the pilot cities, implying that government intervention has a positive influence on pollution prevention in the transport sector. Moreover, the green traffic system construction can be popularized in other cities to mitigate air pollution.},

In this paper, we construct a theoretical model and use the ``Chinese Carbon Emissions Trading Pilot Policy'' as a quasi-natural experiment to accurately identify the net causal effect of this environmental policy on enterprise innovation. Moreover, we use the synthetic control and difference-in-differences methods to eliminate the endogeneity to a large extent and conduct the robustness tests, difference-in-differences method, placebo test, and permutation test to respectively confirm these results. The results show that the implementation of carbon emissions trading policy will significantly reduce the enterprise innovation in general, this conclusion is contrary to the EU ETS's effect, which is confirmed by plenty of previous empirical study. However, this policy has different effects across enterprises of different industries and different types of innovation. It can promote enterprise innovation of environmental industry, but it will inhibit enterprise innovation of non-environmental industry; besides, it can promote the development of green technical innovation and inhibit non-green technical innovation, which is basically identical to the causal effect of EU ETS.},

Although global integration models address sustainability in organisations, these models present shortcomings and limitations and do not describe how to achieve the integration of sustainability. This paper proposes an Activity-Based Sustainability (ABS) integration model that complements other models from an inside-out perspective. Its assessment follows a procedure similar to that proposed by the Activity-Based Costing (ABC) model of cost accounting. The model assigns impacts from activities in the value chain of a process to the objects of impact (products, services, clients, or markets) that must be managed in terms of sustainability. The main limitations of the ABS model are the need to identify and describe processes, to locate every activity that constitutes the value chain, and to quantify the impacts of these activities. The ABS model is presented as an alternative to link sustainable management accounting and sustainable communication, as well as sustainable management control and sustainability assessment. It connects these sustainable elements through the bilateral identification of the linkages among skills, processes, and practices. It also links these aspects with the contribution to sustainable development and the development of competitive advantages.},

A careful comparative study is needed to clarify whether these indicators are actually coherent with each other. We analyze and compare five sustainable development indicators. Pearson correlation was used to make a comparative study among them. Within the two groups, the indicators are positively correlated. The Sustainable Development Index (SDI) of the second group also shares a negative correlation with the Human Development Index. On the other side, the Emergy Sustainability Index was negatively correlated with the Environmental Performance Index, and had little or no correlation with the Environmental Sustainability Index. Furthermore, when examining the scores obtained from the different SDIs, the results demonstrate that they might present somewhat conflicting findings, if not considering their complementarity. This, from one side, depends on the fact that Human Development Index (HDI), Environmental Performance Index (EPI), and Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) provide a short-term local perspective on ``sustainability'', while the Emergy-based Sustainability Index (EmSI) and Surplus Biocapacity are more long-term and global in their perspective. HDI, EPI, and ESI have a more social and economic focus, including indicators whose dynamics are disjoined from the natural one. The emerging differences might be explained through the analysis of the individual sub-indicators for each of the SDIs.},

While statistical results show that the topic of sustainability and value modeling is trending in literature, findings from content analysis reveal that recent attempts to promote a value-based view in the sustainability discussion remain at a strategic level, with most of the proposed indicators being suited for managerial decision-making. The lack of support at operational level points to the opportunity of cross-pollinating sustainability research with value-centered methodologies originating from the aerospace sector.

In this sense, several models have been proposed in order to help companies achieve greater understanding of the dynamics of eco-innovation or even structure and facilitate the integration of sustainable processes within them. These eco-innovation models may be classified into different ways, because they not always have the same approach or common language, in terms of applicability and purpose. Classification is an essential tool to facilitate the diffusion of this field of knowledge and to achieve a higher maturity level on the concept of eco-innovation. Through a systematic literature review on eco-innovation models, this study aims to present gaps and opportunities for the advancement of the field, outlining promising directions regarding potential research areas, contents and predominant characteristics for new eco-innovation models. This paper has been developed upon an analytical framework in order to explore the diversity of eco-innovations models and to present suggestions according to several classification criteria (research area, model approach, model characterization, application sectors, generalization level, among others). In general, the models that have been analysed reveal a predominance of generic and descriptive characteristics. Moreover, there is a gap of eco-innovation models related to organizational structural factors and to social aspects of sustainability. Opportunities for normative models can be highlighted, such as methods, tools and models can be adapted to systems and industrial segments. Therefore, this field of knowledge still offers broad possibilities for new research and new eco-innovation models.},

  abstract = {The development of entrepreneurships in the 21st century cannot occur without taking care of the natural environment. The article presents issues related to eco-innovation.
Despite the opportunities offered by eco-innovations, implementation of such initiatives remains to lead to various difficulties. They vary across countries and sectors. The insufficient number of enterprises in Poland and other European countries implement adequate level of eco-innovations. The main aim of this paper is to indicate the causes of this status and activities aimed to develop eco-innovativeness. The benefits and risks connected with implementation of innovative products and technologies were also discussed.
Furthermore, the advantages of and barriers to their implementation into companies were analysed. The entrepreneurs from the least eco-innovative countries emphasize serious barriers, including uncertain demand from the market, uncertain return on investment or too long a payback period for eco-innovation, lack of funds within the enterprise, insufficient access to existing subsidies and fiscal incentive. They are especially afraid of the financial risks, which raises uncertainty and leads to refraining from innovative initiatives. The possibilities were indicated for the entrepreneurs who face problems with the implementation of innovative solutions. Particular attention was paid to the European Union activities for the development of eco-innovations. Numerous programs supporting their implementation were indicated. The article also presents examples of eco-innovation in water and sewage enterprises. It was emphasized that planning of eco-innovative solutions should be based on comprehensive information about actual benefits and possibility of threats to the environment which can be caused by implementation of eco-innovations. The study presents the example of threats resulting from different methods of sewage sludge management.},

They provide many new technological and/or management related approaches to help industries, governments, and society to speed up the transition to sustainable patterns. Efforts on defining and solving problems with the special accent upon a sustainable solution for the use of raw materials and energy, technological advances, product and policy changes are presented and deeply discussed. Improved corporate management for sustainable societal transitions is discussed, highlighting consumer empowerment in sponsoring implementation of innovative cleaner technologies within companies, industrial sectors, supply chains and countries. Multiple examples are provided relating the successful combination of cleaner production in policy structures, illustrating on how the focused work in production sectors is delivering multiplier benefits and creating conditions to facilitate a ``leapfrogged'' path toward SD.},

Specially, we test the moderating effect of resource commitment on the consequences of environmental innovation practices. We collected data from 148 manufacturers in Pearl River Delta, China to test the theoretical model. The statistical results reveal that institutional pressures coming from government's command-and-control instrument, overseas customer pressure and competitive pressure exert significant positive impact on environmental innovation practices, while government's economic incentive instrument and domestic customer pressure do not work. We also find environmental innovation practices have significant positive impact on firms' environmental performance, while the effect on financial performance should be through the mediating role of environmental performance. The further analysis reveals that the relationship between environmental innovation practices and financial performance is moderated by the level of resource commitment. As resource commitment increases, the financial performance yielded from environmental innovation practices will be better.},

We differentiate between different types of environmental innovations, which will be disentangled in those aiming at reducing the negative externalities and those allowing for efficiency increases and cost savings. What we analyse is at first the extent to which these two typologies have impacts on firms' profitability with opposite signs, and, secondly, whether the motivations driving the adoption of those innovations make the difference in terms of economic gains. We find empirical evidence that both the typology of Environmental Innovation and the driver of their adoption affect the sign of the relationship between competitiveness and environmental performance. Innovations leading to a reduction in the use of energy or materials per unit of output positively affect firms' competitiveness. Contrarily, externality reducing innovations hamper firms' competitiveness. The empirical strategy is based on a sample of German firms and makes use of a merge of two waves of the Mannheim Innovation Panel in 2011 and 2009 that allow overcoming some endogeneity issues which may arise in a cross-section setting.},

We analyse the determinants of environmental innovation intention. We also analyse the effects of environmental innovation behavior on economic performance and environmental performance in different provinces and of different corporate ownership. We find that environmental innovation behavior has a greater effect on environmental performance than economic performance. Innovation in production processes, in particular, positively affects environmental performance for Korean-owned firms in Jiangsu. We also find that wholly Korean-owned firms (WKOEs) are more receptive to environmental innovation than Sino-Korean joint ventures. It is important to enhance environmental innovation within Korean-owned firms in China. Environmental innovation should concentrate on improving production processes in Jiangsu.},

We focus on process eco-innovation, which pertains to technological and non-technological solutions that result in a reduction of material and energy costs for companies. In this regard, the study sheds light on the drivers and outcomes of process eco-innovation adoption, using data collected from 223 Slovenian companies. The results reveal that certain determinants (i.e., competitive pressure, customer demand, managerial environmental concern, command-and-control instrument, and economic incentive instrument) are conducive to the deployment of process eco-innovation. Empirical evidence reveals competitive pressure as the most influential driving force of process eco-innovation, followed by managerial environmental concern and customer demand. Effectiveness in spurring process eco-innovation is also found to be a command-and-control instrument and an economic incentive instrument, while expected benefits do not spur process eco-innovation. Pertaining to the outcomes of process eco-innovation adoption, we can conclude that it pays to be eco; process eco-innovation is worthwhile in terms of company profitability, growth, and competitive benefits. These findings suggest several courses of action for both policy makers and companies. Hence, we conclude by providing implications for both.},

The employed method is based on the content analysis of corporate disclosures and a new technique for assessing the adoption of the corporate sustainability concept (embracing the environmental, social, and financial aspects of a company's policies at the same time). Using extensive data of FTSE 350 firms covering the years 2006\textendash{}2012, 65 companies were selected as meeting corporate sustainability criteria. For the above period, we find that these firms were characterized by higher financial risk exposure, lower asset growth rates, lower BV/MV ratios, lower EVA ratios, and higher MVA ratios. Such relations were generally present among different size and industry groupings. The results support the thesis that firms that incorporate sustainability issues into their business operations are better able to leverage their resources toward stronger financial performance and shareholder value creation than other companies. The paper contributes to the literature by offering a more holistic approach to corporate sustainable performance measurement and shedding additional light on its relation to financial performance in the context of the recent global financial crisis and its direct aftermath.},

However, NPIs have adverse impacts on the environment. But what do we know about the impact of technological green NPIs on firm profitability? Can technological green products help limit or off-set the negative impact of NPIs on the environment? Accelerating the number of NPIs imposes additional costs for firms as well as environmental costs, particularly with greater resource depletion and waste generation. A well-supported solution to reconcile the economic-environmental preservation imperative is to create incentives for firms to use green technologies to offset the negative impact of new products on the environment. Using data on 1020 technological green products which were introduced between 2007 and 2012 by 79 global firms, we investigate whether there are any win\textendash{}win situations in terms of financial advantages for firms, while reducing the adverse impacts of NPIs on the environment. The results show that the relationship between technological green NPIs and firm profitability is positive. The findings point to the financial incentives for firms to leverage on green technologies to limit the environmental impact of new product introductions.},

We analyze a panel sample of non-financial firms in the Netherlands over the period 2001\textendash{}2014 using two approaches: ordinary least squares regressions and two-stage least squares regressions. Our two-stage least squares regressions show that firms with higher degrees of environmental efforts have better firm performance, measured as return on assets, but have poorer firm performance, measured as return on sales. However, this relationship disappears when firm performance is measured as return on equity or stock return. Our analysis further reveals that better firm performance does not necessarily lead to a disclosure of a firm's environmental efforts. We find that larger firms are more inclined to report the environmental efforts than smaller firms. Neither prior firm performance nor variation in firm performance moderates the effect of environmental efforts on firm performance.},

We study the influence of green initiatives and green performance on financial performance for the top 500 publicly traded companies in the USA by industry sector. Green initiatives are measured using the concepts Green Pay Link, Sustainability Themed Committee and Audit. Green performance is measured using Energy Productivity, Carbon Productivity, Water Productivity, Waste Productivity and Green Reputation. The results show that green initiatives have a negative impact on Energy Productivity and Green Reputation, and that both green initiatives and green performance have a significant impact on financial performance. These results are mixed and vary by industry sector. The results suggest that companies take a reactive, not proactive, approach in the implementation of green initiatives. In addition, the results suggest that the impact of green performance on financial performance is not immediate, and may take more than a year for companies to observe.

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to give a comprehensive and cohesive description of the most recent version of the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD), and also to describe and discuss the overall method for developing the FSSD, elaborate on the general rational for and general benefits of a framework of this type, and validate benefits of the FSSD through examples of its application. The purpose is also to point to pertinent future work. In preparation of this paper, we have reviewed previous publications and other documents related to the FSSD and reflected on the 25-year learning process between scientists and practitioners. We conclude that the FSSD has proven to aid organizations in thoroughly understanding and putting themselves in context of the global sustainability challenge, and to move themselves strategically towards sustainability, i.e., to stepwise reduce their negative impacts on ecological and social systems at large while strengthening the own organization through capturing of innovation opportunities, including new business models, exploration of new markets and winning of new market shares, and through reduced risks and operation costs. Specifically, we conclude that the FSSD aids more effective management of system boundaries and trade-offs, makes it possible to model and assess sustainable potentials for various materials and practices before investments are made, and offers the possibility for more effective collaboration across disciplines and sectors, regions, value-chains and stakeholder groups. We also conclude that the FSSD makes it possible to prevent damages, even from yet unknown problems, and not the least, to guide selection, development and combination of supplementary methods, tools, and other forms of support, which makes it possible to increase their utility for strategic sustainable development. Finally, we have shown that the FSSD is useful for structuring transdisciplinary academic education and research. Several examples of ongoing FSSD related research, as well as ideas for future work, are given.},

  abstract = {Green innovation is an important approach for achieving sustainable development. Most research on determinants of corporate green innovation has focused on either external or internal drivers. Combining institutional theory and resource-based view, the scientific value of this study lies in simultaneously exploring the influence of external legitimacy pressure and internal corporate profitability, and their interaction on green innovation. Samples of the top 100 listed companies in China, from 2008 to 2012, were used and the results demonstrated that legitimacy pressure from stakeholders has a significantly positive influence on both corporate green product innovation and process innovation. The results also revealed that corporate profitability positively affects green product innovation, while there was found to be no significant influence on green process innovation. Moreover, corporate profitability positively moderates the relationship between legitimacy pressure and green product innovation. The results show that not only the single factor of external legitimacy pressure and internal profitability, but also their interaction, affects corporate green innovation practices. This offers an integrating perspective on how corporations can be more innovative in sustainability.},

However, firms doubt whether it pays to be green and whether it is worthwhile to disclose their environmental information, and there are hot debates on these questions in the literature. This paper analyzes the relationships among corporate environmental performance, environmental information disclosure, and financial performance in China, which witnessed rapid growth at the price of environmental degradation. With 950 observations from 475 Chinese listed companies between 2013 and 2014, we find a U-shaped nonlinear relationship between corporate environmental performance and environmental disclosure, an insignificant relationship between environmental performance and financial performance, and a negative relationship between environmental disclosure and financial performance, which is different from most findings in developed countries. The aforementioned results imply that Chinese firms have few motivations to disclose environmental information or improve environmental performance; therefore, mandatory disclosure of environmental information is necessary, and proper environmental policy should be made to punish environmental violations and encourage better environmental performance. \textcopyright{} 2017 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

He demonstrates how social business transforms lives; offers practical guidance for those who want to create social businesses of their own; explains how public and corporate policies must adapt to make room for the social business model; and shows why social business holds the potential to redeem the failed promise of free-market enterprise.},

However, few empirical studies have attempted to investigate green investment in China at the sector level. Using panel data for 5 sectors in China between 2003 and 2012, we tested the relationships between investment and different factors, including carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction policies and energy structure, by building panel models for the national sample. The results demonstrated that investment did not become green and mainly relied on gross domestic product (GDP) during the 2003\textendash{}2012 period in China. Although investments in the industry sector and the commerce and services sector were weakened by the CO2 emission regulations, Chinese climate policies had no effect on investment in the agriculture sector or the construction sector and had a positive effect on investment in the transportation sector. Moreover, the proportion of total energy consumption involving coal use had no effect on investment in the construction sector or the commerce and services sector but had a negative effect on investments in the agriculture sector and the transportation sector. Investment in the industry sector showed strong viscosity to low-price coal consumption. Finally, we propose a series of policy implications based on the test results, which may guide green investment.},

  abstract = {The management of the plastic fraction is one of the most debated issues in the discussion on integrated municipal solid waste systems. Both material and energy recovery can be performed on such a waste stream, and different separate collection schemes can be implemented. The aim of the paper is to contribute to the debate, based on the analysis of different plastic waste recovery routes. Five scenarios were defined and modelled with a life cycle assessment approach using the EASEWASTE model. In the baseline scenario (P0) the plastic is treated as residual waste and routed partly to incineration with energy recovery and partly to mechanical biological treatment. A range of potential improvements in plastic management is introduced in the other four scenarios (P1\textendash{}P4). P1 includes a source separation of clean plastic fractions for material recycling, whereas P2 a source separation of mixed plastic fraction for mechanical upgrading and separation into specific polymer types, with the residual plastic fraction being down-cycled and used for ``wood items''. In P3 a mixed plastic fraction is source separated together with metals in a ``dry bin''. In P4 plastic is mechanically separated from residual waste prior to incineration. A sensitivity analysis on the marginal energy was carried out. Scenarios were modelled as a first step assuming that marginal electricity and heat were based on coal and on a mix of fuels and then, in the sensitivity analysis, the marginal energy was based on natural gas. The study confirmed the difficulty to clearly identify an optimal strategy for plastic waste management. In fact none of the examined scenarios emerged univocally as the best option for all impact categories. When moving from the P0 treatment strategy to the other scenarios, substantial improvements can be obtained for ``Global Warming''. For the other impact categories, results are affected by the assumption about the substituted marginal energy. Nevertheless, irrespective of the assumptions on marginal energy, scenario P4, which implies the highest quantities of specific polymer types sent to recycling, resulted the best option in most impact categories.},

Results from a life cycle assessment show that the proposed system could significantly reduce the carbon, energy and water footprints of the current system, even for very pessimistic scenarios for bag purchase and recovery rates. However, wider implementation of the proposed business model depends on the accessibility of the deposit/collection system, acceptance of such a `take-back' system by retail managers, greater environmental awareness among customers and regulatory mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Plastics are integral part of society and have varied application. Plastics are composed of a network of molecular monomers bound together to form macromolecules. There are increasing concerns due to non degradability and generation of toxic gases on combustion during incineration. Due to fabrication of desired shape colour and specification convenient to customers there is increasing application in packaging, agriculture, automobiles and biomedical. They are indispensable to the modern generation due to development in information technology, intelligent and smart packaging system. Efforts are in progress for development of efficient and precise conversation of renewable raw materials into innovative polymeric product through recent technologies which are superior in terms of performance, environmental and cost perspectives. In rivers and at coastal regions the marine pollution is increasing at a faster rate due to indiscriminate disposal by the consumers. R\&D studies are now centred for investigating whether consumption of plastic debris by marine organism translates into toxic exposures for people who consume seafood with particular relevance to plasticisers, stabilizers, heavy metals viz phthalates, BPA, lead cadmium, methyl mercury. Biological effects from pollution are linked with resulting economic effects and losses. A cornerstone of sustainable development is the establishment of affordable, effective and truly sustainable waste management practices in developing countries. Plastic waste management is a critical issue. Over 300 million metric tons of plastics are produced in the world annually and about fifty percent of this volume is for disposal applications, product that are discarded within a year of their purchase. It is the boon and bane of our times. Although there are multiple uses, its waste and the resultant pollution clogs up our rivers, oceans, lands and adversely affects the biodiversity. We need to plan for disposal of new synthetic product, implants etc which have completed their shelf life. In future polymeric adhesives and implants are to be developed which address total joint replacement features for patients with varied complications and age. It should be robust, biocompatible with surface treatment options to allow for reduced friction and wear throughout the implant life. In a CPCB supported study we have found that the soil and ground water quality may be affected in dumpsite areas. The International Organisation for standardization [ISO] Organisation for Economic Cooperation [OECD] and development, British specification [BS] Indian Standards [IS] need to be implemented for appropriate application and safe disposal. Globally steps are being taken for development of environmental friendly, innovative plastic items using the concept of green chemistry and also with safe disposal methods. Integrated waste management practices are to be encouraged, strengthened and supported with state of art scientific applications.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study is to present the results of a life cycle assessment performed for different scenarios reflecting the management, treatment and handling of plastic solid waste as a fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW) in the Greater London area. The study is divided in two parts: Part I comprises a LCA on the current MSW management strategy adopted in the Greater London area. This includes a materials recovery route via a dry Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) and an energy recovery route (incineration unit (IU) with combined heat and power). Part II investigates two alternative thermo-chemical treatment (TCT) technologies for the management of plastic solid waste (PSW): a low temperature pyrolysis (LTP) reactor and a hydrogenation reactor (VCC). The LTP process recovers valuable chemicals and petrochemicals (e.g., gases (C3\textendash{}C4), liquid fractions (naphtha), waxes (atmospheric residue, AR) and heat in the form of steam), whilst the hydrogenation process produces syncrude and e-gas which is comparable to natural gas. The system expansion methodology was applied to the scenarios developed. A sensitivity analysis investigated different degrees of material recovery and reprocessing for the substitution of the relevant conventional processes. At the same time the study tackled the impact on the environment of introducing TCT units with the aim of petrochemicals' recovery. Results showed that the current waste management system is more environmentally friendly compared with the landfill scenario for all the impact categories investigated. Moreover, the employment of the alternative TCT technologies investigated depends on the market's ability to take-in the petrochemical by-products hence replacing their conventional production. Scenarios including pyrolysis appeared to be more environmentally friendly in terms of Greenhouse gas emissions when compared with hydrocracking, while the reverse was true for the eutrophication potential category.},

These scenarios are applied to the waste amount and composition of the Municipality of Roma (Italy) and are evaluated under different points of view: global and local emissions, total material demands, total energy requirements and ecological footprints. Results, reliable for most of the European big cities, show landfill systems as the worst waste management options and significant environmental savings at global scale are achieved from undertaking energy recycling. Furthermore, waste treatments finalized to energy recovery provide an energy output that, in the best case, is able to meet the 15\% of Roma electricity consumption.},

  abstract = {With the rapid expansion of municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration, the applicability, technical status, and future improvement of MSW incineration attract much attention in China. This paper aims to be a sensible response, with the aid of a comparison between China and some representative developed regions including the EU, the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan area. A large number of up-to-date data and information are collected to quantitatively and impartially support the comparison, which covers a wider range of key points including spatial distribution, temporal evolution, technologies, emissions, and perspectives. Analysis results show that MSW incineration is not an outdated choice; however, policy making should prevent the potentially insufficient utilization of MSW incinerators. The structure of MSW incineration technologies is changing in China. The ratio of plants using fluidized bed is decreasing due to various realistic reasons. Decision-makers would select suitable combustion technologies by comprehensive assessments, rather than just by costs. Air pollution control systems are improved with the implementation of China's new emission standard. However, MSW incineration in China is currently blamed for substandard emissions. The reasons include the particular elemental compositions of Chinese MSW, the lack of operating experience, deficient fund for compliance with the emission standard, and the lack of reliable supervisory measures. Some perspectives and suggestions from both technical and managerial aspects are given for the compliance with the emission standard. This paper can provide strategic enlightenments for MSW management in China and other developing countries.},

Successive messages emphasizing the characteristics of plastic are delivered to consumers allowing explaining the influence of information on the consumers' WTP. We find that information has a manifest effect on the WTP. We show there is a significant premium associated with recycled plastic packaging and biodegradable bioplastic packaging. As there is no consensus on the plastic which is the most or the least dangerous for the environment, we propose different policies for protecting the environment. We discuss about the impact of these policies on consumer's purchasing decisions: switching one plastic packaging for another, or leaving water plastic bottles market. We present the environmental policies that are effective according to the point of view adopted. Choosing between these policies then depends on the priorities of the regulator and pressure of lobbies.},

This study analyzes the effect of the plastic bag tax on consumer behavior to learn how it was received and determine the perceived effectiveness of the tax 4months after its implementation. In addition, the study assessed how proximity to coastal areas could influence behaviors and opinions. The results showed a 74\% reduction of plastic bag consumption with a simultaneously 61\% increase of reusable plastic bags after the tax was implemented. Because plastic bags were then reused for shopping instead of garbage bags, however, the consumption of garbage bags increased by 12\%. Although reduction was achieved, the tax had no effect on the perception of marine litter or the impact of plastic bags on environment and health. The majority of respondents agree with the tax but view it as an extra revenue to the State. The distance to the coast had no meaningful influence on consumer behavior or on the perception of the tax. Although the tax was able to promote the reduction of plastics, the role of hypermarkets and supermarkets in providing alternatives through the distribution of reusable plastic bags was determinant to ensuring the reduction.},

The aim is to quantify the environmental consequences of different alternatives in order to evaluate opportunities and limitations to select the best and most feasible plastic waste recovery option to decrease the GHG emissions. The methodologies of material flow analysis (MFA) for a time period of thirteen years and consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) have been integrated. The study focuses on Spain as a representative country for Europe. The results show that to improve resource efficiency and avoid more GHG emissions, the options for plastic waste management are dependent on the quality of the recovered plastic. The results also show that there is an increasing trend of exporting plastic waste for recycling, mainly to China, that reduces the GHG benefits from recycling, suggesting that a new focus should be introduced to take into account the split between local recycling and exporting.},

  abstract = {In the USA, local governments have the primary responsibility to manage MSW. However, local governments lack the authority to explicitly shift costs or responsibility back onto the producer for specific problem wastes. A particularly problematic waste for local governments is the single-use plastic bag. In 2014, in the USA, 103.465 billion single-use plastic shopping bags were consumed. Because of their extremely low recyclability rate, plastic bags remain a significant source of land-based litter and marine debris and impair stormwater management systems. They also reduce the effectiveness of automated recycling systems. In response, local governments increasingly have adopted a variety of measures specifically intended to reduce the store-level consumption of single-use shopping bags in 5 major categories: bans, imposition of fees and taxes, establishing minimum product design of bags, requiring consumer education, and mandating retailer take-back programs. As of September 2017, there were 271 local governments in the USA with plastic bag ordinances covering 9.7\% of the nation's population. The majority (95\%) of the ordinances is a ban on single-use plastic bags; 56.9\% of these bans also include a mandatory fee on paper and/or reusable bags. For the fee-based ordinances, the mode is \$0.10 per bag; every tax/fee ordinance allows retailers to retain some or all the collected fee. As local governments continue to increase their actions on plastic bags, 11 states have enacted laws to prohibit local governments from regulating single-use plastic bags. Because of the success with single-use bags, local governments are also enacting similar ordinances on single-use expanded polystyrene consumer products and other single-use plastic products.},

The results show that scholars have not reached a consensus regarding the concept of ZW. While some studies fully address this philosophy, other studies are based on just one or on some of its topics. The benefits were grouped and organized into four dimensions: benefits to the community, financial-economic benefits, benefits to the environment and benefits to the industry and stakeholders. As to the challenges, barriers were identified both in the macro environment (mainly political and cultural) and in the meso and micro environments (stakeholders, industries, and municipalities). The analysis of the articles enabled listing critical success factors, supported by a set of activities that must be carried out. Regarding future studies, it is worth noting that more empirical studies about ZW implementation are necessary, particularly with regard to educational practices designed to promote changes in user behavior.},

Second, we highlight the measurement level of the underlying data screens as an important determinant of the actual effects of CSP on CFP. Focusing on climate change, we developed a set of questions that cover a firm's carbon emissions and carbon management strategies. These questions were included in a questionnaire sent out annually to the 2,500 largest companies by market cap within the Dow Jones Global Index by an independent Swiss-based asset management firm. Our results show that when using carbon emissions as an outcome-based measurement, corporate environmental performance pays off. Conversely, when using carbon management as a process-based measurement, we find a negative relationship between corporate environmental performance and CFP.},

Using survey data collected from a wide variety of firms and industries based in the United States, we empirically examined the antecedents and effects of integrating the natural environment into the formal planning process. These data were analysed using structural equation modelling with the LISREL technique. Overall, our data provided strong support for the hypothesized relationships. Specifically, we found that the level of integration of environmental management concerns in the strategic planning process was positively related to financial and environmental performance. Furthermore, we found that the greater the functional coverage and the more resources provided to environmental issues, the greater the integration of environmental issues in the planning process. These results suggest that concern for environmental issues may yield competitive advantages in the marketplace as the natural resource-based perspective suggests},

In this study of 108 SMEs in the automotive repair sector in Southern Spain, we found that SMEs undertake a range of environmental strategies from reactive regulatory compliance to proactive pollution prevention and environmental leadership. These strategies are associated with three organizational capabilities: shared vision, stakeholder management, and strategic proactivity, hypothesized based on the unique strategic characteristics of SMEs--shorter lines of communication and closer interaction within the SMEs, the presence of a founder's vision, flexibility in managing external relationships, and an entrepreneurial orientation. We also found that firms with the most proactive practices exhibited a significantly positive financial performance.},

Just as the creation of shareholder value requires performance on multiple dimensions, the global challenges associated with sustainable development are also multifaceted, involving economic, social, and environmental concerns. Indeed, these challenges have implications for virtually every aspect of a firm's strategy and business model. Yet, most managers frame sustainable development not as a multidimensional opportunity, but rather as a one-dimensional nuisance, involving regulations, added cost, and liability. This approach leaves firms ill-equipped to deal with the issue in a strategic manner. Accordingly, we develop a sustainable-value framework that links the challenges of global sustainability to the creation of shareholder value by the firm. Specifically, we show how the global challenges associated with sustainable development, viewed through the appropriate set of business lenses, can help to identify strategies and practices that contribute to a more sustainable world while simultaneously driving shareholder value; this we define as the creation of sustainable value by the firm.},

  abstract = {Interest in eco-innovation in the corporate environment has grown considerably in recent years. Given the profound role of eco-innovation, it is therefore important to obtain a better understanding on the latest research progress in the academia and the recent organizational efforts in practice. This review paper addresses this need and contributes to the current literature in three ways. First, this paper presents a descriptive overview on eco-innovation in the corporate environment by examining 395 representative articles published from 2006 to 2015, collected from the Social Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index databases. The characteristics of the terminologies and journals, prevailing themes and changes, the geographical location of prolific authors and main geographical context of research studies in eco-innovation are identified to unravel the evolution of the concerned research studies and institutional contexts. Second, by using co-word and social network analyses, this study finds that the current literature on eco-innovation in the corporate environment is mainly focused on nine areas, including the influence of stakeholders, drivers of eco-innovation, eco-innovation systems, eco-design, new product developments, product service systems, environmental management systems, green supply chain management, and performance \& small medium enterprises (SMEs). Third, this~study~provides an extended conceptual framework that incorporates the notion of `driver$\rightarrow$source$\rightarrow$position$\rightarrow$performance' (D$\rightarrow$S$\rightarrow$P$\rightarrow$P) to find the relationships among the research topics in the eco-innovation field. This framework allows examination of the overall strategies for eco-innovation in the corporate environment so that a firm can gain a competitive edge through their adoption, implementation, assessment, and investment. This systematic review will benefit practitioners and academics by providing the major strands of research in the current studies on eco-innovation. This study also provides insights into four distinctive features of eco-innovation in the corporate environment as well as research gaps of recent eco-innovation studies. This study thus provides future research directions for subsequent eco-innovation research, as well as insights for managers and policy makers on how to enhance and strategize strategies for eco-innovation in the corporate environment.},

  abstract = {Environmental management has external effects such that companies typically regard environmental input as a cost with no clear benefit. If the investment only leads to additional costs, companies will not take the initiative to achieve long-term environmental protection. Therefore, if environmental protection can bring economic benefits, indicating that environmental protection and economic interests are in harmony, companies will actively fulfill their responsibility to protect the environment. Thus, it is important to examine the relationship between corporate environmental management and financial performance. This paper examines the relationship between environmental management and financial performance of Chinese listed firms from 2007 to 2011. Results indicate that environmental management is significantly positively related to financial performance in the following year, implying that environmental management can significantly improve future profitability. However, as environmental investment consumes capital and resources, results indicate that environmental management is not significantly related to improved financial performance in the current year. In addition, this study examines the relationship between different environmental protection measures and financial performance, finding that two methods of environmental protection, ``recycled harmful substances to the environment (Rec)'' and ``other methods to control pollution (Other),'' positively impact future financial performance. However, these measures also do not have a significant impact on the financial performance of the current year.},

Drawing on a hybrid theoretical framework (combining the theoretical reasoning of the natural-resource-based view (NRBV) with instrumental stakeholder and slack resources arguments), we address the apparent lack of consensus by meta-analytically integrating the findings of 149 studies. We pay particular attention to two highly material issues: the direction of causality and the multidimensionality of the focal constructs. Meta-analytic results indicate that there is a positive and partially bidirectional relationship between CEP and CFP. In addition, our findings suggest that the relationship is stronger when the strategic approach underlying CEP is proactive rather than reactive. Furthermore, we reveal moderation effects of methodological artifacts, which may provide explanations for the inconsistency of the results of previous studies. Based on our findings, we discuss the implications and outline avenues for further research.},

To this end, we obtain data for a sample of 2982 large firms from 2008 to 2015. We apply Petersen's approach to these data, adjusting the standard errors for clustering by both firm and year. The results obtained show that the adoption of environmental practices significantly and positively affects the corporate financial performance in developed and developing countries.

First, practitioners are queried for their view on the link between CEP and CFP and how to measure it. Since the vast majority see a positive relationship, this study contributes with a new form of evidence that it pays to be green. The chosen qualitative approach also allows a more detailed analysis of underlying cause-and-effect mechanisms. For instance, interviewed practitioners emphasize a direct and indirect impact from CEP on CFP. Second, the study conducts interviews with experts from research and associations (non-practitioners) and compares the viewpoints of the two interview groups. One prevalent difference refers to the fact that non-practitioners do not focus on the two impact levels. Moreover, business experts perceive the link between CEP and CFP as much less complex and reveal more pragmatically oriented considerations. The study then discusses how the interview results and identified differences can be used to direct future research and to support corporations in their move towards sustainability.},

This textbook, which has been road-tested and refined through over a decade of teaching and workshops, offers a coherent conceptual framework for Human Ecology \textendash{} a clear approach for understanding the many systems we are part of and how we frame and understand the problems we face. By giving rigorous definitions it guides readers out of the current `conceptual swamp' that hinders communication and collaboration \textendash{} with a particular focus on terms such as "sustainability" and "cultural adaptation", that need generally agreed definitions before they can support clear communication. It also clarifies the role of Human Ecology, and similar disciplines, by bringing ethical and justice considerations into the assessment of different interventions to promote sustainability.

The virtual team literature suggests that these teams often experience process losses compared to their face-to-face counterparts. In this paper we propose that as virtualness increases, a team's shared mental models become more complex; this limits the effectiveness of particular teamwork behaviors: mutual performance monitoring, backup behavior and adaptation. We identify specific factors that are reflected in increased mental model complexity of virtual teams. Further we examine the moderating role that the accuracy and similarity of these shared mental models as well as the level of virtualness has on the relation between complexity and teamwork behaviors. Finally, we examine the effects of training inventions on mental model accuracy. To this end, we review the existing literature to develop a model and specific propositions.},

However, prior work has not adequately mapped the effect of these elements of complexity on performance. We report an experiment where subjects managed an inventory in the face of stochastic sales, a classic dynamic decision task. We vary the time delays and strength of the feedback loops to explore the impact of these elements of dynamic complexity on behavior. Subjects faced financial incentives and had opportunities to learn. Yet performance was significantly worse than optimal across all conditions. Subjects outperformed a naive "do-nothing" rule in the simple conditions, but performance deteriorated dramatically with increasing time delays and feedback effects, and most were outperformed by the do-nothing rule in the complex conditions. Regression analysis of subjects${'}$ decisions showed most ignored the supply line of pending production and undercontrolled the system. Undercontrol increased significantly with growing time delays and feedback strength, showing subjects were insufficiently adaptive despite perfect knowledge of system structure and parameters. Subjects${'}$ understanding of complex feedback settings declines as delays between cause and effect increase and as actions have stronger side effects. Few indications were found of active experimentation or learning: the need to control seemed to override the ability to learn.},

  abstract = {Studies in the psychology of individual choice have identified numerous cognitive and other bounds on human rationality, often producing systematic errors and biases. Yet for the most part models of aggregate phenomena in management science and economics are not consistent with such micro-empirical knowledge of individual decision-making. One explanation has been the difficulty of extending the experimental methods used to study individual decisions to aggregate, dynamic settings. This paper reports an experiment on the generation of macrodynamics from microstructure in a common managerial context. Subjects manage a simulated inventory distribution system which contains multiple actors, feedbacks, nonlinearities, and time delays. The interaction of individual decisions with the structure of the simulated firm produces aggregate dynamics which systematically diverge from optimal behavior. An anchoring and adjustment heuristic for stock management is proposed as a model of the subjects' decision processes. Econometric tests show the rule explains the subjects' behavior well. The estimation results identify several `misperceptions of feedback' which account for the poor performance of the subjects. In particular, subjects are shown to be insensitive to the feedbacks from their decisions to the environment. Finally, the generality of the results is considered and implications for behavioral theories of aggregate social and economic dynamics are explored.},

  abstract = {This article explores the links between agency, institutions, and innovation in navigating shifts and large-scale transformations toward global sustainability. Our central question is whether social and technical innovations can reverse the trends that are challenging critical thresholds and creating tipping points in the earth system, and if not, what conditions are necessary to escape the current lock-in. Large-scale transformations in information technology, nano- and biotechnology, and new energy systems have the potential to significantly improve our lives; but if, in framing them, our globalized society fails to consider the capacity of the biosphere, there is a risk that unsustainable development pathways may be reinforced. Current institutional arrangements, including the lack of incentives for the private sector to innovate for sustainability, and the lags inherent in the path dependent nature of innovation, contribute to lock-in, as does our incapacity to easily grasp the interactions implicit in complex problems, referred to here as the ingenuity gap. Nonetheless, promising social and technical innovations with potential to change unsustainable trajectories need to be nurtured and connected to broad institutional resources and responses. In parallel, institutional entrepreneurs can work to reduce the resilience of dominant institutional systems and position viable shadow alternatives and niche regimes.},

In Study 2, tests of actual creative performance were administered in 2 different settings.

  shorttitle = {A Review on Circular Economy},
  abstract = {In the last few years Circular Economy (CE) is receiving increasing attention worldwide as a way to overcome the current production and consumption model based on continuous growth and increasing resource throughput. By promoting the adoption of closing-the-loop production patterns within an economic system CE aims to increase the efficiency of resource use, with special focus on urban and industrial waste, to achieve a better balance and harmony between economy, environment and society. This study provides an extensive review of the literature of last two decades, with the purpose of grasping the main CE features and perspectives: origins, basic principles, advantages and disadvantages, modelling and implementation of CE at the different levels (micro, meso and macro) worldwide. Results evidence that CE origins are mainly rooted in ecological and environmental economics and industrial ecology. In China CE is promoted as a top-down national political objective while in other areas and countries as European Union, Japan and USA it is a tool to design bottom-up environmental and waste management policies. The ultimate goal of promoting CE is the decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth. The implementation of CE worldwide still seems in the early stages, mainly focused on recycle rather than reuse. Important results have been achieved in some activity sectors (e.g. in waste management, where large waste recycling rates are achieved in selected developed countries). CE implies the adoption of cleaner production patterns at company level, an increase of producers and consumers responsibility and awareness, the use of renewable technologies and materials (wherever possible) as well as the adoption of suitable, clear and stable policies and tools. The lesson learned from successful experiences is that the transition towards CE comes from the involvement of all actors of the society and their capacity to link and create suitable collaboration and exchange patterns. Success stories also point out the need for an economic return on investment, in order to provide suitable motivation to companies and investors. In summary, the CE transition has just started. Moreover, the interdisciplinary framework underpinning CE offers good prospects for gradual improvement of the present production and consumption models, no longer adequate because of their environmental load and social inequity, a clear indicator of resource use inefficiency.},

In a comprehensive map, the classification points out mutual overlaps between engineering disciplines in terms of similar complexity management approaches.Finally, the treatise introduces a generic complexity management framework, which is based on structural management approaches.},

  abstract = {In many European countries, renewable energy has evolved through decentralised and small-scale forms of organisation. These different initiatives are often denominated as community energy in both research and practice. By examining community energy initiatives through a social entrepreneurship lens, we develop an integrated approach for the analysis of small-scale and bottom up energy initiatives. Our approach relies on three specific analytical dimensions: the purpose of the initiative, its form of organisation and ownership, and its embeddedness into local community or wider social movements. We apply this analytical framework to four case studies selected from a larger empirical study on newly emerged forms of organisation in the field of renewable energy across the European Union. Drawing on our findings, we characterise social enterprises in the energy sector as collectively owned organisations that combine renewable energy production with more overarching goals of environmental and social transformation, and a specific quest for civic participation. These initiatives show strong relationships with different social movements and even a potential to transcend the local scale. We conclude that given similarities in the two areas of research provide fertile ground for mutual advancement, both conceptually and empirically.},

The situation is not different in Europe, where the process began much earlier than in the United States and today at least fifteen European Union member states have specific laws for social enterprise. This article will describe the current state of the legislation on social enterprise in Europe, inquiring into its fundamental role in the development of the social economy and its particular logics as distinct from those of the for-profit capitalistic economy. It will explore the models of social enterprise regulation that seem more consistent with the economic growth inspired by the paradigms of the social economy. It will finally explain why, in regulating and shaping social enterprise, the model of the social enterprise in the cooperative form is to be preferred to that of the social enterprise in the company form.},

  abstract = {The contemporary industrial metabolism is not sustainable. Critical problems arise at both the input and the output side of the complex: Although affordable fossil fuels and mineral resources are declining, the waste products of the current production and consumption schemes (especially CO2 emissions, particulate air pollution, and radioactive residua) cause increasing environmental and social costs. Most challenges are associated with the incumbent energy economy that is unlikely to subsist. However, the crucial question is whether a swift transition to its sustainable alternative, based on renewable sources, can be achieved. The answer requires a deep analysis of the structural conditions responsible for the rigidity of the fossil-nuclear energy system. We argue that the resilience of the fossil-nuclear energy system results mainly from a dynamic lock-in pattern known in operations research as the ``Success to the Successful'' mode. The present way of generating, distributing, and consuming energy\textemdash{}the largest business on Earth\textemdash{}expands through a combination of factors such as the longevity of pertinent infrastructure, the information technology revolution, the growth of the global population, and even the recent financial crises: Renewable-energy industries evidently suffer more than the conventional-energy industries under recession conditions. Our study tries to elucidate the archetypical traits of the lock-in pattern and to assess the respective importance of the factors involved. In particular, we identify modern corporate law as a crucial system element that thus far has been largely ignored. Our analysis indicates that the rigidity of the existing energy economy would be reduced considerably by the assignment of unlimited liabilities to the shareholders.},

Factor analysis was employed to identify the key institutional pressures (i.e. coercive, normative and mimetic pressures), internal green practices (i.e. green shipping practices and green operations), external green collaborations (i.e. green collaboration with supplier, green collaboration with partner, and green collaboration with customer), and green performance (i.e. reduction of pollutants, and perceived green brand) dimensions. We collected data from surveyees employed by 129 container shipping companies and agencies in Taiwan, and applied a structural equation model (SEM) to test the research hypotheses. The findings revealed that institutional pressures have positive effects on internal green practices; internal green practices positively influence external green collaborations; internal green practices and external green collaborations positively influence green performance but institutional pressure is not positively associated with external green collaborations. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications are presented to help container shipping operators improve green performance.},

  shorttitle = {Empirical Studies Omit Reporting Necessary Details},
  abstract = {Context
Empirical studies are essential in evaluating the effectiveness of Model-based Testing (MBT) research and should be reported properly to ensure their replication and to highlight the strengths and limitations of the MBT techniques being evaluated. Researchers have proposed guidelines detailing what information should be reported when presenting empirical studies and what should be the structure of such primary studies. There is a need to evaluate the reporting quality of the empirical studies in MBT literature.
Objective
To evaluate the reporting quality of empirical studies in the model based testing domain; identifying where the reported studies fail to follow the proposed guidelines and finding frequently omitted details. As an auxiliary goal we aim to quantify the percentage of empirical studies conducted in industrial context.
Method
We evaluate the reporting quality and the execution contexts of MBT empirical studies reported in literature. For our study we consider the MBT papers published in top ten software engineering journals over the last eighteen years. We evaluate the published primary studies using the empirical study reporting guidelines.
Results
We found 87 empirical in MBT that met our selection criteria. Initial results showed that the existing guidelines were not only too strict (for example they demand presence of specific sections rather than simply having the details present in the paper), they also did not adequately cover MBT specific details. Therefore, we propose modified the guidelines for reporting empirical studies in MBT and re-evaluated the selected studies. Results show that while only a few empirical studies follow the exact structure proposed by the guidelines, approximately half the papers contain at least 50\% of the required details. Most of the papers omit details related to process and analysis leading to presented results. We found a positive trend of improving reporting quality of empirical studies in MBT over the last Eighteen years. Another important finding from the review is that few reported studies were conducted in real industrial context.
Conclusions
Model based testing community needs to be more aware of the reporting guidelines and more effort should be spent on reporting the necessary details. Furthermore, we found that only few studies that are conducted in industrial context and hence more focus should be given to empirical case studies in real industry context. However, the reporting quality of research papers presenting empirical evaluations is gradually improving.},

  abstract = {Currently, the concern with the environment is increasing and organizations seek solutions to preserve nature and at the same time earn higher profits or competitiveness. For this, they make frequent use of structured procedures in order to reduce their costs and expenses. However, it has not been always considered the environmental performance related to the financial performance of these processes. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between environmental performance measured by eco-efficiency level with the financial performance of small and medium textile manufacturing companies. This study was done through a survey conducted in the interest of research companies in the state of Paran{\'a} in Brazil, where financial and environmental performance indicators were measured. The data analysis and validation of the hypotheses proposed, to some extent showed a surprising result because the larger the size of the company, the worst its environmental performance measured by their eco-efficiency level. On the other hand, it was not possible to identify a statistically significant relationship between environmental and financial performances of the companies surveyed. Therefore, it is concluded that this study is in line with those authors who claim not to be possible to establish a direct relationship between environmental and financial performances of companies, in opposition of another group of authors who claim contrariwise.},

  shorttitle = {Smartphone-Enabled Social Change},
  abstract = {There are two axioms that have shaped the degrowth discussion, namely one on the reduction of production and consumption and one on the necessity of value and attitude change in society to respect environmental limits. Surprisingly little research has focused on the role of technology in connection to value change, consumption behavior and degrowth. This gap is linked to a widely held assumption of technological innovation acting contrary to degrowth. In contrast, this paper suggests that technological innovation needs to be connected to degrowth. In particular, the fast evolution of information and communication technologies in recent years points to their importance for the global civil society. Given the scope of sustainability challenges connected to these technologies and smartphones in particular, this paper argues that a degrowth movement going hand in hand with technological development is only made possible, if sustainable alternatives for highly demanded products are offered. Specifically, this study draws on lifestyle movements as the nexus between consumption, degrowth and technology. Three core concepts are found to influence the attendance to degrowth-related consumer movements: a sustainable lifestyle, alternative forms of consumption and social commitment, all of which are assumed to have a positive effect. Empirically this paper draws on the case of the Fairphone, a company that applies sustainable characteristics to a smartphone. Data collected in a survey via online fora of the Fairphone from November 4\textendash{}29, 2015 are analyzed using a structural equation modeling with partial least squares. Results indicate that a sustainable lifestyle represents the dominant factor explaining the involvement with the Fairphone. Surprisingly, the findings show that alternative consumption seems to negatively influence the involvement with the Fairphone and social commitment seems to play a minor role in the model. These aspects point to the Fairphone as a technical artifact, centered on a choice for a sustainable lifestyle. Future research needs to reach clarification on the relationship of alternative consumption and degrowth related movements and whether the negative effect is case specific or beyond. Furthermore, future studies need to delve deeper into lifestyle decisions as a leverage point towards degrowth, especially on lifestyles understood as a from of activism to change contemporary society.},

  abstract = {Technical specifications appropriate for the recycling of agricultural plastic wastes (APWs), widely accepted by the recycling industry were developed. The specifications establish quality standards to be met by the agricultural plastics producers, users and the agricultural plastic waste management chain. They constitute the base for the best economical and environmental valorisation of the APW. The analysis of the APW streams conducted across Europe in the framework of the European project ``LabelAgriWaste'' revealed the inherent characteristics of the APW streams and the inherent constraints (technical or economical) of the APW. The APW stream properties related to its recycling potential and measured during pilot trials are presented and a subsequent universally accepted simplified and expanded list of APW recycling technical specifications is proposed and justified. The list includes two sets of specifications, applied to two different quality categories of recyclable APW: one for pellet production process (``Quality I'') and another one for plastic profile production process (``Quality II''). Parameters that are taken into consideration in the specifications include the APW physical characteristics, contamination, composition and degradation. The proposed specifications are focused on polyethylene based APW that represents the vast majority of the APW stream. However, the specifications can be adjusted to cover also APW of different materials (e.g. PP or PVC) that are found in very small quantities in protected cultivations in Europe. The adoption of the proposed specifications could transform this waste stream into a labelled commodity traded freely in the market and will constitute the base for the best economical and environmental valorisation of the APW.},

The data were obtained from documents on port wastes organized in a relational database with defined protocols (closed form). Analysis of the spreadsheets prepared and field visits revealed that the main bottleneck in managing plastic wastes at ports is their segregation. In general, more material is segregated and sent for recycling from leased areas than non-leased ones (administered by the government). This relatively better performance in managing the wastes generated in leased areas is probably due to the need for private operators to comply with the international standards such as the Code of Environmental Practice to satisfy the international market.},

Considerable progress has been made in determining the amount and location of plastic debris in our seas, but how much plastic actually enters them in the first place is more uncertain. Jambeck et al. combine available data on solid waste with a model that uses population density and economic status to estimate the amount of land-based plastic waste entering the ocean. Unless waste management practices are improved, the flux of plastics to the oceans could increase by an order of magnitude within the next decade.
Science, this issue p. 768
Plastic debris in the marine environment is widely documented, but the quantity of plastic entering the ocean from waste generated on land is unknown. By linking worldwide data on solid waste, population density, and economic status, we estimated the mass of land-based plastic waste entering the ocean. We calculate that 275 million metric tons (MT) of plastic waste was generated in 192 coastal countries in 2010, with 4.8 to 12.7 million MT entering the ocean. Population size and the quality of waste management systems largely determine which countries contribute the greatest mass of uncaptured waste available to become plastic marine debris. Without waste management infrastructure improvements, the cumulative quantity of plastic waste available to enter the ocean from land is predicted to increase by an order of magnitude by 2025.
Millions of tons of plastic waste end up in our oceans every year.

  abstract = {A survey revealed that researchers still seem to encounter difficulties to cope with outliers. Detecting outliers by determining an interval spanning over the mean plus/minus three standard deviations remains a common practice. However, since both the mean and the standard deviation are particularly sensitive to outliers, this method is problematic. We highlight the disadvantages of this method and present the median absolute deviation, an alternative and more robust measure of dispersion that is easy to implement. We also explain the procedures for calculating this indicator in SPSS and R software.},

Because reaction time distributions are skewed, however, the computation of restricted means introduces a bias: the restricted mean underestimates the true average of the population of response times. This problem may be very serious when investigators compare restricted means across conditions with different numbers of observations, because the bias increases with sample size. Simulations show that there is substantial differential bias when comparing conditions with fewer than 10 observations against conditions with more than 20. With strongly skewed distributions and a cutoff of 3.0 standard deviations, differential bias can influence comparisons of conditions with even more observations.},

We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4.\hspace{0.6em}Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations.

In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming.

* We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature.

* Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.},

The relationship is very strong when x is continuous, weaker when x is discrete, and non-existent as the order of the distributed lag becomes infinite. The individual specific random variables introduce nonlinearity and heteroskedasticity; so the paper provides an appropriate framework for the estimation of multivariate linear predictors. Restrictions are imposed using a minimum distance estimator. It is generally more efficient than the conventional estimators such as quasi-maximum likelihood. There are computationally simple generalizations of two- and three-stage least squares that achieve this efficiency gain. Some of these ideas are illustrated using the sample of Young Men in the National Longitudinal Survey. The paper reports regressions on the leads and lags of variables measuring union coverage, SMSA, and region. The results indicate that the leads and lags could have been generated just by a random intercept. This gives some support for analysis of covariance type estimates; these estimates indicate a substantial heterogeneity bias in the union, SMSA, and region coefficients.},

Moreover, there exists bidirectional causality between CO2 emissions and energy consumption, and also between energy consumption and economic growth. It has also been found that energy consumption and economic growth are the long-run causes for CO2 emissions and CO2 emissions and economic growth are the long-run causes for energy consumption. The results indicate that China's CO2 emissions will not decrease in a long period of time and reducing CO2 emissions may handicap China's economic growth to some degree.

However, prior empirical studies provide indefinite conclusions. The purpose of this study is to review systematically and quantify the CSR\textendash{}CFP link in a meta-analytic framework. Based on 119 effect sizes from 42 studies, this study estimates that the overall effect size of the CSR\textendash{}CFP relationship is positive and significant, thus endorsing the argument that CSR does enhance financial performance. Furthermore, this work sheds light on the causal relationship between CSR and CFP. Subsequent financial performance is associated with prior social responsibility, while the reverse direction is not supported. This finding supports the instrumental stakeholder theory. As predicted, the meta-analysis results indicate that the measurement strategies of the two key constructs of CSR and CFP explain some variations of the CSR\textendash{}CFP relationship. Last, this study examines the moderating effect of the environmental context on the CSR\textendash{}CFP link. This work proposes that CSR in the developed world, with a relatively mature institutional system and efficient market mechanism, will be more visible than CSR in the developing world. The results show that the CSR\textendash{}CFP relationship is stronger for firms from advanced economies than for firms from developing economies.},

  abstract = {Theoretical discussions and empirical studies on the nexus between corporate social responsibility/corporate social performance and corporate financial performance have never ceased since the origin of the concepts. The development trajectories of such studies should be articulated with a view to informing practical corporate social responsibility applications and theoretical studies in the future. This paper presents a critical review of relevant empirical research articles on the nexus between corporate social performance and corporate financial performance published during the ten-year period from 2002 to 2011. Using mixed-methods of content analyses and statistical analyses, the paper reviews 84 empirical studies of this kind published during the period. The results indicate that, despite the enormous amount of previous studies, the corporate social performance and corporate financial performance nexus is a line of inquiry that remains inconclusive. The pattern of corporate social performance-corporate financial performance relationship research in the decade examined has shifted towards exploring the linkages between specific aspects of the two constructs. The positive relationships between these specific aspects in dual directions are confirmed by most of the studies examined in this paper. The paper also examines the impact of time and space change on the corporate social performance-corporate financial performance nexus. The findings show that researchers have gradually recognized that the relationship is not static but changes over time. Furthermore, the paper finds that corporate social responsibility has been increasingly debated in developing countries and in specified industrial settings. The review concludes that to explore the corporate social performance-corporate financial performance nexus by contextualizing it in a specified community, and/or examine its dynamics is a promising research area that can yield significant academic and practical values.},

This is because many factors indirectly influence this relation. Therefore, this study considers sustainable competitive advantage, reputation, and customer satisfaction as three probable mediators in the relationship between CSR and firm performance. The findings from 205 Iranian manufacturing and consumer product firms reveal that the link between CSR and firm performance is a fully mediated relationship. The positive effect of CSR on firm performance is due to the positive effect CSR has on competitive advantage, reputation, and customer satisfaction. The final findings show that only reputation and competitive advantage mediate the relationship between CSR and firm performance. Taken together, these findings suggest a role for CSR in indirectly promoting firm performance through enhancing reputation and competitive advantage while improving the level of customer satisfaction.},

Although mediation is used in certain areas of psychology, it is rarely applied in cognitive psychology and neuroscience. One reason for the scarcity of applications is that these areas of psychology commonly employ within-subjects designs, and it is only recently that statistical mediation has been worked out satisfactorily for such designs. Here, we draw attention to the importance and ubiquity of mediational hypotheses in within-subjects designs, and we present a general and flexible software package for conducting a Bayesian within-subjects mediation analyses in the R programming environment. We use experimental data from cognitive psychology to illustrate the benefits of within-subject mediation for theory testing and comparison.},

Our simulations show that the instrumental variable and GMM estimators are unreliable, and sensitive to the presence of unobserved heterogeneity, residual serial correlation, and changes in control parameters. The bias-corrected fixed-effects estimators, based on an analytical, bootstrap, or indirect inference approach, are found to be the most appropriate and robust methods. These estimators perform reasonably well even in models with fractional dependent variables censored at [0,1]. We verify these results in two empirical applications, on dynamic capital structure and cash holdings.},

While the technical literature has disputed some of Baron and Kenny's tests, this literature has not diffused to practicing researchers. We present a nontechnical summary of the flaws in the Baron and Kenny logic, some of which have not been previously noted.

  abstract = {The direct effect of one event on another can be defined and measured by holding constant all intermediate variables between the two. Indirect effects present conceptual and practical difficulties (in nonlinear models), because they cannot be isolated by holding certain variables constant. This paper presents a new way of defining the effect transmitted through a restricted set of paths, without controlling variables on the remaining paths. This permits the assessment of a more natural type of direct and indirect effects, one that is applicable in both linear and nonlinear models and that has broader policy-related interpretations. The paper establishes conditions under which such assessments can be estimated consistently from experimental and nonexperimental data, and thus extends path-analytic techniques to nonlinear and nonparametric models.},

An alternative perspective, that has received less attention in the literature, is that this relationship can be mediated by other contextual variables such as financial performance. Thus, this study is aiming to provide some empirical evidence on this issue that may help in explaining divergence in prior work. Panel data regression was performed on a sample that includes all firms that are listed in the Egyptian social responsibility index during the period from 2007 to 2010. The results demonstrate that better (or worse) financial performance, and rather social responsibility, is the lead for institutional investors when they make their investment decisions.},

In this study, we examined the frequency with which popularly used tests disagree, whether the method an investigator uses makes a difference in the conclusion he or she will reach, and whether there is a most trustworthy test that can be recommended to balance practical and performance considerations. We found that tests agree much more frequently than they disagree, but disagreements are more common when an indirect effect exists than when it does not. We recommend the bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval as the most trustworthy test if power is of utmost concern, although it can be slightly liberal in some circumstances. Investigators concerned about Type I errors should choose the Monte Carlo confidence interval or the distribution-of-the-product approach, which rarely disagree. The percentile bootstrap confidence interval is a good compromise test.},

To attain the article's objective, an empirical analysis of 45 Italian companies over the four-year period 2012\textendash{}2015 was performed using return on assets to evaluate financial performance, and utilizing separate waste collection rates and collection per capita as proxies for good environmental practices. The results show the existence of a very high general connection and a slight positive linear correlation, which means that if one variable grows, the other one also increases, even if the proportion may vary. In other words, for the analyzed companies, the research findings seem to exclude the possibility that the financial results may deteriorate as a consequence of improved environmental practice in the form of separate waste collection.},

However, the ability to effectively communicate research findings is crucial for success in the biological sciences. Graduate students are encouraged to publish early and often, and professional scientists are generally evaluated by the quantity of articles published and the number of citations those articles receive. It is therefore important that undergraduate students receive a solid foundation in scientific writing early in their academic careers. In order to increase the emphasis on effective writing in the classroom, we assembled a succinct step?by?Step guide to scientific writing that can be directly disseminated to undergraduates enrolled in biological science courses. The guide breaks down the scientific writing process into easily digestible pieces, providing concrete examples that students can refer to when preparing a scientific manuscript or laboratory report. By increasing undergraduate exposure to the scientific writing process, we hope to better prepare undergraduates for graduate school and productive careers in the biological sciences.},

In order to detect outliers in panel data models, this paper presents a modeling method to assess the intervention effects based on the variance of remainder disturbance using an arbitrary strictly positive twice continuously differentiable function. This paper also provides a Lagrange Multiplier (LM) approach to detect and identify a general type of outlier. Furthermore, fixed effects models and random effects models are discussed to identify outliers and the corresponding LM test statistics are given. The LM test statistics for an individual-based model to detect outliers are given as a particular case. Finally, this paper performs an application using panel data and explains the advantages of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Environmental protection and sustainable development have become an important issue in today's global economy.  However, there are only limited requirements for environmental disclosure for publicly-held firms in the United States.  This study first measures the environmental disclosure of S\&P 100 firms based on keyword frequency count of their 10k reports from 2004 to 2008.  It also examines the relationships between environmental disclosure, firm performance and firm characteristics.  Our results indicate that environmental disclosure actually has a significant negative impact on firm performance after controlling for firm size, growth and leverage. The results imply that more environmental disclosure may indicate potential environmental problems within the firm and that this may hamper the firm's financial performance.  We also find that better-performing firms and highly-leveraged firms tend to have lower environmental disclosures.  It implies that these firms may have better compliance with environmental laws and regulations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Although researchers have applied different theoretical perspectives to illustrate the relationship between corporate environmental responsibility and profitability, to date theories are contested and empirical findings are inconclusive. Therefore, the aim of this research was to present empirical evidence regarding the influence of engaging in environmental responsibility on corporate market value, as the first study to be applied in the Egyptian context. The findings demonstrate that the market compensates those firms that care for their environment, as environmental responsibility exerted a positive and significant coefficient on the firm market value measured by Tobin's q ratio. This aligns stakeholder theory as well as resource?based theory arguments, and provides supporting evidence for those studies that have concluded that it pays to be environmentally responsive.

We examine whether and how different components of economic sustainability disclosure (ECON), as well as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) dimensions of sustainability performance affect cost of equity, individually and in aggregate. In addition, we investigate whether and how ECON and ESG sustainability interactively affect cost of equity capital. Costs of equity are calculated using industry adjusted earnings\textendash{}price ratios and finite horizon expected return model. Using a sample of more than 3000 firms during 1990\textendash{}2013, we find that ECON (ESG) is negatively associated with cost of equity, but only growth and research (environmental and governance) sustainability performance dimensions contribute to this relationship. Operation efficiency is positively, while social sustainability performance is only marginally, related to cost of equity. We also find that ECON and ESG sustainability performance interactively affect cost of equity. In general, the relationship between ECON (ESG) and cost of capital is strengthened when ESG (ECON) performance is strong.},

The Poisson FE model is particularly simple and is one of a small few known models in which the incidental parameters problem is, in fact, not a problem. The same is not true of the negative binomial (NB) model. Researchers are sometimes surprised to find that the HHG formulation of the FENB model allows an overall constant a quirk that has also been documented elsewhere. We resolve the source of the ambiguity, and consider the difference between the HHG FENB model and a  true  FENB model that appears in the familiar index function form.The familiar RE Poisson model using a log gamma heterogeneity term produces the NB model. The HHG RE NB model is also unlike what might seem the natural application in which the heterogeneity term appears as an additive common effect in the conditional mean. We consider the lognormal model as an alternative RENB model in which the common effect appears in a natural index function form.},

The analysis compares innovation and productivity of firms with similar features but different environmental activities. Firms are matched on a rich set of covariates extending the Coarsened Exact Matching to survey data. Matched data are analysed with parametric and non-parametric tests and endogenous treatment regression. The analysis shows that the relationship between green management and performance is U-shaped. Green firms are performing no better than firms with no environmental activity, especially in energy intensive sectors. Among green firms, more advanced environmental management is associated with higher performance. Overall, the results suggest that green management has strong sectoral patterns and no linear relationship with performance. Findings suggest that green managers should pursue a comprehensive environmental management system. Sectoral-specific policies to promote environmentally friendly activities are needed when green activities are not paying off.},

We begin by reviewing the sources of endogeneity\textemdash{}omitted variables, simultaneity, and measurement error\textemdash{}and their implications for inference. We then discuss in detail a number of econometric techniques aimed at addressing endogeneity problems, including instrumental variables, difference-in-differences estimators, regression discontinuity design, matching methods, panel data methods, and higher order moments estimators. The unifying themes of our discussion are the emphasis on intuition and the applications to corporate finance.},

Studies finding high environmental compliance costs have traditionally focused on static cost impacts, ignoring any offsetting productivity benefits from innovation. They typically overestimated compliance costs, neglected innovation offsets, and disregarded the affected industry's initial competitiveness. Rather than simply adding to cost, properly crafted environmental standards can trigger innovation offsets, allowing companies to improve their resource productivity. Shifting the debate from pollution control to pollution prevention was a step forward. It is now necessary to make the next step and focus on resource productivity.},

In the concluding section, applications of the model for both single business strategy and corporate strategy are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract The hypotheses that a firm's environmental performance has a positive impact on its financial performance and vice versa are statistically supported by Japanese data. However, this tendency for two?way positive interaction appears to be only a relatively recent phenomenon. The tendency for realizing the two?way interaction is not limited to the top?scoring firms in terms of both financial and environmental performance. On the contrary, this is also a trend that can be observed fairly generally. Obviously, when we consider only scores of those companies that published the relevant information in their environmental reports, and conduct the statistical causality test with such information as additional input to the pooled time?series and cross?section data of financial performance, the results become more strongly significant. From the recent experience of environmental policies in Japan, we infer that information?based environmental policy measures are effective to encourage the ongoing transition toward a more sustainable market economy.

We study the influence of green initiatives and green performance on financial performance for the top 500 publicly traded companies in the USA by industry sector. Green initiatives are measured using the concepts Green Pay Link, Sustainability Themed Committee and Audit. Green performance is measured using Energy Productivity, Carbon Productivity, Water Productivity, Waste Productivity and Green Reputation. The results show that green initiatives have a negative impact on Energy Productivity and Green Reputation, and that both green initiatives and green performance have a significant impact on financial performance. These results are mixed and vary by industry sector. The results suggest that companies take a reactive, not proactive, approach in the implementation of green initiatives. In addition, the results suggest that the impact of green performance on financial performance is not immediate, and may take more than a year for companies to observe.

We show that the relationship between firms' return on assets (ROA) and ECSR, strengths and concerns, is negative and statistically significant. We also show that firms' Tobin Q and ECSR, strengths and concerns, are negatively correlated in a statistically significant way. However, accounting for the interaction between firms' environmental efforts and R\&D yields a different perspective: while the direct impact of ECSR on CFP is still negative, the interaction of ECSR and R\&D has a positive and significant impact on it. ECSR strengths and concerns harm CFP since they are perceived as a potential cost. However, this CSR activity fosters R \& D efforts of firms which generates additional value (indirect effect).},

  abstract = {Background/Aims
In human case-control association studies, population heterogeneity is often present and can lead to increased false-positive results. Various methods have been proposed and are in current use to remedy this situation.

Methods
We assume that heterogeneity is due to a relatively small number of individuals whose allele frequencies differ from those of the remainder of the sample. For this situation, we propose a new method of handling heterogeneity by removing outliers in a controlled manner. In a coordinate system of the c largest principal components in multidimensional scaling (MDS), we systematically remove one after another of the most extreme outlying individuals and each time recompute the largest association test statistic. The smallest p value obtained within M removals serves as our test statistic whose significance level is assessed in randomization samples.

Results
In power simulations of our method and three methods in current use, averaged over several different scenarios, the best method turned out to be logistic regression analysis (based on all individuals) with MDS components as covariates.

Conclusion
Our proposed method ranked closely behind logistic regression analysis with MDS components but ahead of other commonly used approaches. In analyses of real datasets our method performed best.},

We establish the exact distribution of a pivotal type statistics based on this generalized Mahalanobis distance, which provides critical points for the identification of outlier data points. Based on the equivalence between the modified Cook's distance and what is called the mean-shift multivariate outlier elliptical model, twelve new modifications are proposed for the Cook's distance. We also describe the explicit relationship between the Cook's distance and the likelihood displacement with the modified Cook's distance.

  abstract = {Outlier removal is common in hormonal research. Here we investigated to what extent removing outliers in hormonal data leads to divergent statistical conclusions. We first show that the most common outlier detection rule is based on a number of standard deviations (SD) from the mean. Next, we used simulations to examine the degree to which statistical conclusions diverge when a test with outlier exclusion yields a statistically significant result whereas the test with outlier inclusion did not, or vice versa (at p = .05). Simulations were run in duplicate for independent samples t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA designs, and based on real testosterone (T) data and a theoretical gamma distribution of T data. We ran simulations for different sample sizes (30 to 100) and outlier removal rules (2.5 SD and 3 SD). For significant t-tests, we found that in between 14 \% to 55 \% of the significant cases a test with outlier exclusion yielded a statistically significant result whereas the test with outlier inclusion did not, or vice versa (median p difference: .03\textendash.06). For significant repeated measures ANOVAs, we found that in between 7 \% to 28 \% of significant cases a test where outlier exclusion yielded a statistically significant result whereas the test with outlier inclusion did not, or vice versa (median p difference: .01\textendash.03). When reporting any test that would lead to a statistically significant result (either the test with inclusion or exclusion of outliers (or both)), in between 5.15 \% and 6.89 \% of the independent sample t-tests were statistically significant, and for the repeated measures ANOVA design this was between 6.32 \% and 7.62 \% of the tests. Our results suggest that outlier handling can have a substantial impact on significance testing. We suggest several potential solutions for handling outliers and we argue for a careful assessment of handling outliers in hormonal data.},

Understanding different within and between effects is crucial when choosing modeling strategies. The downside of Random Effects (RE) modeling\textemdash{} correlated lower-level covariates and higher-level residuals\textemdash{}is omitted-variable bias, solvable with Mundlak's (1978a) formulation. Consequently, RE can provide everything that FE promises and more, as confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulations, which additionally show problems with Pluemper and Troeger's FE Vector Decomposition method when data are unbalanced. As well as incorporating time-invariant variables, RE models are readily extendable, with random coefficients, cross-level interactions and complex variance functions. In the appendix, an empirical example shows that disregarding these extensions can produce misleading results. We argue not simply for technical solutions to endogeneity, but for the substantive importance of context/heterogeneity, modeled using RE. The implications extend beyond political science to all multilevel datasets. However, omitted variables could still bias estimated higher-level variable effects; as with any model, care is required in interpretation.},

  abstract = {Background
When unaccounted-for group-level characteristics affect an outcome variable, traditional linear regression is inefficient and can be biased. The random- and fixed-effects estimators (RE and FE, respectively) are two competing methods that address these problems. While each estimator controls for otherwise unaccounted-for effects, the two estimators require different assumptions. Health researchers tend to favor RE estimation, while researchers from some other disciplines tend to favor FE estimation. In addition to RE and FE, an alternative method called within-between (WB) was suggested by Mundlak in 1978, although is utilized infrequently.

Methods
We conduct a simulation study to compare RE, FE, and WB estimation across 16,200 scenarios. The scenarios vary in the number of groups, the size of the groups, within-group variation, goodness-of-fit of the model, and the degree to which the model is correctly specified. Estimator preference is determined by lowest mean squared error of the estimated marginal effect and root mean squared error of fitted values.

Results
Although there are scenarios when each estimator is most appropriate, the cases in which traditional RE estimation is preferred are less common. In finite samples, the WB approach outperforms both traditional estimators. The Hausman test guides the practitioner to the estimator with the smallest absolute error only 61\% of the time, and in many sample sizes simply applying the WB approach produces smaller absolute errors than following the suggestion of the test.

Conclusions
Specification and estimation should be carefully considered and ultimately guided by the objective of the analysis and characteristics of the data. The WB approach has been underutilized, particularly for inference on marginal effects in small samples. Blindly applying any estimator can lead to bias, inefficiency, and flawed inference.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the effects of environmental performance on financial performance using the data of Japanese manufacturing firms from 2004 to 2008. As the environmental performance, our study considers the two different environmental issues of waste and greenhouse gas emissions in capturing the effects of corporate environmental management on financial performance. In addition, to clarify how each financial performance responds to a firm's effort in dealing with different environmental issues, we utilize many financial performance indices reflecting various market evaluations. Our estimation results show the different effects of each environmental performance on financial performance. Waste emissions do not generally have significant effects on financial performance. On the other hand, greenhouse gas reduction leads to an increase in financial performance in the whole sample and clean industries, although it does not have significant effects on financial performance in dirty industries. Furthermore, as the firm growth rate increases, the partial effects of waste emissions on financial performance decrease, whereas the partial effects of greenhouse gas emissions on financial performance increase.},

This discrepancy suggests that we must enlarge the spectrum of analysis to understand when it pays to be green. The way in which society takes a stance on environmental responsibility is deeply bounded to the cultural lenses through which it sets its priorities. A cultural perspective can help explain the capacity for social phenomena to shape behaviour. We consider how the contextual environment of culture, thus far neglected, might moderate the corporate environmental performance\textendash{}corporate financial performance relationship and thus influence firms' capacity to offset the costs of environmental management. By using a sample of 954 companies, we contribute to the long-running debate, showing how the effect of cultural influence can overcome the hurdle of contrasting results and offer novel insights for both academia and practitioners.},

In this study, we test empirically the Porter hypothesis and the competing hypothesis that regulation undermines profitability (``costly regulation hypothesis''). In particular, we estimate the effect of clean water regulation, as reflected in the stringency of firm-specific effluent limits for two regulated pollutants, on the profitability of chemical manufacturing firms. As our primary contribution, we contrast the effect of clean water regulation on actual profitability outcomes and its effects on investors' expectations of profitability. Our results for actual profitability are consistent with the Porter hypothesis, while our results for expected profitability are consistent with the costly regulation hypothesis. Thus, our empirical results demonstrate that investors do not appear to value the positive effect of tighter clean water regulation on actual profitability.},

This paper examines the potential impact these additional restrictions have on investment performance by comparing the performance characteristics of a carefully constructed, well diversified portfolio of socially screened stocks with two unrestricted benchmark portfolios. In contrast to prior research, the performance of the socially responsible portfolio examined in this paper is not subject to the confounding effects of trans- action costs, management fees, or differences in investment policy that are associated with actively managed mutual funds. Therefore, it is possible to more clearly isolate the potential performance implications associated with subjecting the investment opportunity set to social screening. Contrary to expectations, our findings indicate that application of social-responsibility screens does not necessarily have an adverse impact on investment performance.},

We provide empirical support for our arguments by developing a method for estimating firms' project CAPM betas and project returns. Our findings justify the continued use of the CAPM by firms in spite of the mounting evidence against it based on the cross section of stock returns.},

They then compared results for analyses with nonimputed missing data and with imputed data both in long and in wide structures. Imputation produced improved estimates in the event-history analysis but only modest improvements in the estimates and standard errors of the fixed effects analysis. Factors responsible for differences in the value of imputation are examined, and recommendations for handling missing values in panel data are presented.},

In addition, multilevel models have become a standard tool for analyzing the nested data structures that result when lower level units (e.g., employees) are nested within higher level collectives (e.g., work groups). When applying MI to multilevel data, it is important that the imputation model takes the multilevel structure into account. In the present paper, based on theoretical arguments and computer simulations, we provide guidance using MI in the context of several classes of multilevel models, including models with random intercepts, random slopes, cross-level interactions (CLIs), and missing data in categorical and group-level variables. Our findings suggest that, oftentimes, several approaches to MI provide an effective treatment of missing data in multilevel research. Yet we also note that the current implementations of MI still have room for improvement when handling missing data in explanatory variables in models with random slopes and CLIs. We identify areas for future research and provide recommendations for research practice along with a number of step-by-step examples for the statistical software R.},
