# Hypotheses

Here are my three hypotheses based on @LiUnderstandingImpactGreen2017 and @Chencrosscountrycomparisongreen2018 :

* **H1:** The higher the level of green initiatives (Pay Link, Sustainability Themed Committee and Audit), the higher the level of green performance (Energy Productivity, Carbon Productivity, Water Productivity, Waste Production and Green Revenue).

* **H2:** The higher the level of green performance (Energy Productivity, Carbon Productivity, Water Productivity, Waste Production and Green Revenue), the higher the level of financial performance (ROA and Tobin's Q). 

* **H3:** The higher the level of green initiatives (Pay Link, Sustainability Themed Committee and Audit), the higher the level of financial performance (ROA and Tobin's Q).
