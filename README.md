# Thesis
Project: This repository contains the project of my master's thesis submitted in fulfillment of the requirements for the Masterâ€™s Degree in Business Management and Administration, Finance Specialization at the University of Namur, Belgium.

Academic year : 2017-2018

The repository is organized following the methodology of Gandrud (2013). Each section of this thesis corresponds to an R Markdown file in the Child folder. The Child/ThesisSkeleton.Rmd file is the parent document which merges all the child directories into a consolidated pdf document "ThesisSkeleton.pdf". The Child/Analysis sub-folder contains a list of makefiles whose outputs are saved into Child/Analysis/DataBase.
