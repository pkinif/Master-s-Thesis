The repository is organized following the methodology of Gandrud, Christopher. 2013. Reproducible Research with R and R Studio. New York: Chapman and Hall/CRC. 

Each section of this thesis corresponds to an R Markdown file in the `Child` folder. The `Child/ThesisSkeleton.Rmd` file is the parent document which merges all the child directories into a consolidated pdf document `ThesisSkeleton.pdf`. The `Child/Analysis` sub-folder contains a list of makefiles whose outputs are saved into `Child/Analysis/DataBase`. The final database states in the folder `Thesis/Child/Analysis/DataBase/DataSynchronization/`:

- `NoOutliersLag0`: contains the complete database (i.e. Financial and Environemental data) when no lag and no outliers
- `NoOutliersLag1`: contains the complete database when lag = 1 and no outliers
- `NoOutliersLag2`: contains the complete database when lag = 2 and no outliers
- `FinancialData_1216.csv`: contains the financial database from 2012 to 2016
- `Lag0.csv`: contains the complete database when lag = 0 and outliers are kept
- `Lag1.csv`: contains the complete database when lag = 1 and outliers are kept
- `Lag2.csv`: contains the complete database when lag = 2 and outliers are kept
